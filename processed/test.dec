Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Queen Harry?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Why?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Get out!
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
Her favorite uncle
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
How much?
Are you lost?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...

You don't care if I die
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Were you in jail?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
The duck?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You know what I mean
No what?
No, I won't go with you
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Absolutely not.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
We'll all go crazy...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
Are we going to argue?
Yes... I remember...
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
No?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Thousands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
We can't be.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Then why?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I was all of these.
What's your cut?  How much?
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
It's okay.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Watch the news?
Nah, why should you?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
You got any better ideas?
Of course.
Is that all there is?
I'm serious here.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Answer it.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.  You ready?
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Two weeks holiday.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Don't speak Russian!
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Well, he...
Alright.  Go ahead.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
You hear that question, Garcia?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Okay, come on down.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Yes.
Yes, I thought so.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
But not completely inconceivable?
Two more.
What is it, Hal?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Certainly.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I will if I can, Frank.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
I ain't tired yet.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
No chance.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Must be billy's girl.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
Why?
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Jack?
Yeah?
I'll keep it in mind.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
When? How?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
That's what I always say.
We got a lot to talk about.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
I brought the girl remember?
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Hey bud! Finger here.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
So, just how big was this fare?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
I don't think this is a good time...
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're the only one left alive...
Uh..you're welcome.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Learning language.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I want to sleep... forever...
Because...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Options.
Gentlemen?
Only too well... here you must be parched..
I'm not at the hotel!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Tom... she's dead.
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I promised him to Machine.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Take out your gun!
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You betrayed us.
Alright, Tom.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
It's good what you're doing.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Show me.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Don't think I won't.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Look, you cocksucker...
You are a private investigator?
Never mind how I found you.
Enlighten me.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
It's their Presidential Suite.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
My condolences.
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
You don't have any other choice.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay.
What?
What... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Okay.  Fine.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I'm sure they're around.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Three days.
Who?
It's okay, we're just about there.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Let me talk to you.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
You're not taking my baby!
Huh?
Me too.
Sobering...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
You disappointed in me?
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
I don't know!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
So?
I...don't know!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Something wrong?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Anything ---
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
What direction does the system indicate?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
Thirty-four seconds!
All right - go to it.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Damn straight!
If you get it?
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Sun's gettin high.
Where'd you get the blood?
Lawford?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No what?
I want to go home.
Don't go playing policeman.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Like hell.
I'm fine, fine.
On what you pay me?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
I'm sorry.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Then... I guess you have to.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
His office. You mean my old office.
He got his deer yet?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Yeah.
You and me.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
The night before the shooting.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I'm sorry, honey.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Lemme take a look.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Why?
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Tower, here.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Why? Do you enjoy it?
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Jim...
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Please... don't start with me.
We're under attack.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Who's that, Ted?
Ted!
Not now, Elaine.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Don't be too long.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Maybe.
Negative.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
I'm sure.
A b...
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Then Elaine was right.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
I can't tell.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
No.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
I love you.
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Yes, Captain?
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Huh?
Yes?
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
I like my horizons narrow.
Yes...
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
But I-- .
Screw me?  That can't be right.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Who else can I ask around here?
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Departmental policy.
What?
Yeah, that's comforting.  Mine, too.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Can't lock up...
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Yes.  That follows.
How long until it blows?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
See you soon.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
He's coming in.  I feel safer already.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
About seventeen days.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
No.  Have you?
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Sure.  Go left.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Certainly!
What do you mean?
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
You were sublime.
Don't bother.
And how will you make him keep it?
What are you talking about?
Where?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Eat my - ah!
Of course.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Don't be stupid.
Tell them to go!
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
But! I'm a married woman!
He asked me to stay.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Oh, yes.
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
Well. There it is.
Yes?
I think so, Sire, yes.
What do you mean, Sire?
Twenty-six.
I have no idea.
This one will.
It's a secret.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Why? What has happened?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Can I see it?
Madame.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
You burned the score?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
You flatter me.
What work?
What dead? Who is dead?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
I do.
No! No, it's him!
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Please! Just one moment.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Should I?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
What difference does that make?
Oh my son, my poor son!
Yes?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Well done, Sire!
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
The zoo? Is he rational?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I was. What are you reading?
Twenty-eight.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Now I'm embarrassed.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Lovely.
The bedroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
I'm freezing.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Jack is dead!
What?
Right.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
You're in a hospital in London.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Good.
You're not having a good time are you?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I heard that.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
David!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
Stop it, Jack.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You must believe me.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
I want you to meet some people.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
I want to know why .
Why not?
Yes - sure—
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
I remember once when your account checked.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Just pure luck!
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Fifty thousand dollars!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Get out, get out!
That don't do us any good.
You don't have to do nothing.
Why, I needed a—
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Why are you so anxious?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
Got a handkerchief?
Hello, darling.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Yes, sir.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
But I haven't . . .
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yes.
Yeah, swell.
Yeah.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Yes.
Bought himself a pocketbook!
Now you tell us.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Two.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What's going on?
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
What is wrong with you?
She was European!
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Don't let it happen again.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
Yep.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You ride like a Comanche.
The brown one.
Ah.
Ho-yah!
You're right, sir.
It's a secret.
I'd appreciate that.
Shit.
Died a hero.
Such as?
Heard of him.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
The posters?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
How much of that story is true?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Mmmm.
What?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Yep.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Pity.
Yes?
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I'm not hanged yet.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
Right here in church?
You been with a girl ever?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Don't talk about it much, though.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Yes sir.
No.
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Uh huh.
I know. Stop it.
I'm ignoring you.
Turn the light on.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
I won't...don't worry.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Lucky, I guess.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Patrick?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Oh really? That's great.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Sorry. 
Hello? Jean, I need help!
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Who do you ask?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
Actually, yes.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Had his apartment been burglarized?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Listen, what's your name?
Yeah, well, you're late.
Is that a raincoat?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Isn't that -- extreme?
It was a hate crime.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Nothing.
...Different?
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
You look a little tired.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Were you?
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Then and now.  But not right now.
But why would they --?
Hmm?
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What does that mean?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Care for some saki?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
We know all that, Exposition.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Thanks.
Thank you, Exposition.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Be careful.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Thanks.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Excuse me?
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Sure.
Do I make you horny?
I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I'm sorry.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Are you crazy?
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Is it one of ours?
What are you saying, son?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Blow me.
What did you say?
Show me.
I just don't see it.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
I love you, Vanessa.
And how do you feel about that?
Really?
There are limits?
... bottle ...
Black...
... love...
Peter ...
So I'm still ...
Then who wins?
Hmmm ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Watch me.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
Too many cooks --
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
And I suppose you're the knight.
No thanks.
Strange.
Very good, Steed ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
It wasn't me; you have my word.
As far as you trust me.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Have we been invited?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Not quite.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I see.
Dead, I'm afraid.
You.
Impossible.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
What do you mean?
You're kidding.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Hey, man, congratulations!
Five thousand dollars.
I love that car.
So does Debbie.
Shit!
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Yes I did.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
It looks awful.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
About what?
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I am committed. I love you.
Yes...
You're on.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Quiet, Mother.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Screw that.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Good.
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Feel free.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Mrs.?
The best table in the house.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Still drawing a blank.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Debbie.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Just come down, John. Just --
It works.
That was never proved.
Hey! You don't know me --
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
So hello.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Jennifer.
Really? No kidding.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
How's it going?
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
I was doing my job.
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
The outlets.
See you Monday. Sir.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
I was ahead of my time.
Well, let's have a look.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Fixing my roof.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
You treated me like shit.
Yeah? When was the last time?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn it all.
You don't know... nobody knows...
Alderman.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
Yes.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
How about 7 1/2?
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
I'm on it.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
What do you do?
Why are you smiling so?
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
And I'm the feet.
To what?
I'm sorry I'm late.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Always keep 'em laughing.
So what's up with you?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Thanks.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
He's just playing big brother.
Light?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
He, I'm Mona.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Yes he did.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
What's a Negro.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
You slept too near where you got in?
Maybe you need to start.
We can look out for ourselves.
Y'know what?
Why don't you answer?
Where are you bound for?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
I have acted as I think fit.
And his baggage?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
But how, sir?
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
Certain?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
That is a trifle strong.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Old fool!
Then you must get it.
As much as possible.
Hmm-mmmm.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Dark Valdez.
And he doesn't care about me?
He loves me, as I love you.
Yeah, if you've slept.
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Shut up, Mueller.
Of course --
You saved Kendall's life --
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
How do you know that?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Why?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Yeah...
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
What don't you know?
My heart weeps.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I don't know --
Well, he's a good soldier.
And the problem is you only got three.
Someone must have got a shot off. He wasn't exactly a moving target.
Nevertheless --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Yes.
You made me look like an idiot --
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
Buttfucks the cabin?
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
That's gonna stay my secret.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Tough.
I should probably write that down.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
What the fuck are you doing?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
Then it's unofficial.
It's too neat.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I can get it. I can just...
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Really?
Make him stop.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Can we talk?
They're your favorite flower.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
But it's not true.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes. But that's a different...
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
We'll stop then.
Yeah.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
Good. 
And...
Right.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Oh nothing.
John.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
I said I don't have any.
Oh Jesus.
I don't hate you.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
I got what I paid for.
She's dead.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
Okay. Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Yes?
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
When? Now? Oh. No.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Yeah.
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Yeah.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Let go of my arm...
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Uh-uh.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Get a good picture in your mind.
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
Now, hold up.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Naw!
Go ask him.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
What's on your mind?
Rae!
Yeah, I do.
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Thanks.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Give me a break, would you?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
What's the problem here?
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Are we getting married?
Sure.
It's illegal, Nick.
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
He's got a reason.
What do you chant?
You are a lucky man.  Where you come from a man can stand out.  It's expected.  Here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
I'm amused.
Look.
The families who control the casinos?
Oh?
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Just thought I'd...
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
She's not with you?
Oh!  Day after tomorrow.
Number three.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
Shot of vodka, please.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
True.
But if you could?
Me too.
What the fuck for?
I'd kill it.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Right.
You did?
If they are smart, they take naps.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
But then how can you...
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
What desert?
Same thing.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
They left.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Bravo!
Do ya?
I just had a mental picture of...
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Yes, I'm right?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Get away from me!!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Watching television in color.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Sure.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Everybody's divorced.
Two weeks.
Yes!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Look unimpressed.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Did you?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
My pleasure.
Gee-ma-nee!
Nothing.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Your mom made that all by herself.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Uh-huh.
You're sure?
You nut!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
When did we get it from them?
Sorry, that's the largest city.
I don't think so.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
That would knock my father out.
Almost all of them.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Bye, Adam!
You don't look thirty-five.
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
How do you do, ma'am.
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
I never know anymore.
To you maybe.
How could you?! This is just like home!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Well, we did in my family!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
I don't believe it!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
What do you think, Adam?
Where did he get all that information?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
We came back to the house!
Stop!
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
No.
Yes.
You don't?
I sure don't hate you.
Do you love me?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Would you like a piece of cake?
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Uh-uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm here, aren't I?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Alright.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
Just a minute.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Connor, is that you?
Well, I didn't but...
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
No pictures, either.
For what?
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
I'm serious.
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
A-fuckin'-men!
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
How do you figure?
Male or female, bitch?!!
What about one guy with two guns?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
Hey Murph.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Five, seven, eight dollars.
You think we're going to be chased?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
Sure.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
On the left.
As long as he gets out OK.
Bob?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
Would of been nice.
What?
I don't think we can do that.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
That's not correct.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Who's Mr. Henry?
I did.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
As a person?
It's going back down.
Careful. Check his pulse.
I'll see you there.
What?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
How?
What?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Take a deep breath.
Me?
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Anthony, I'm petrified.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
See you, Bob.
I'm not playing any more golf.
No, I don't mind.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Sure.
Temporarily.
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Bob! Get back in position!
No.
They are.
Let's cut the bullshit.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
You're paranoid, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
His name was Swifty?
Don't count it.
My brother's in jail.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Watch me.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
I know it's not.
Yes, I do.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
What's that?
Now!
I'm trying.
Well, I think --
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
What?
Fight. You know.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
Come on in!
What do you mean?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
No. You lost your way.
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
You killed them.
Because you're afraid!
Sorry. Old habits.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
But it ends up the same.
-- where? -
-- not yet --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
There's no choice.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Who's going? Us?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Who's this?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
If you say so.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
You fancy him.
I don't want to be a martyr.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
I must... consult with my father.
Exactly.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Cute, Evan.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Photos?
Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.
I'm sorry.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
I know, but...
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
Like how?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Who -- who are you?
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
I thought I was the bad guy!
He did. Captain Renault did.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Go back to Bulgaria.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
Er, my check, please.
Practically no one.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Especially tonight.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
You can believe that if you want to.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Goodnight.
Yes, I would.
Ask me?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
I love you very much, my dear.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Not at all.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Yes.
Are you quite finished with us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I expected no less, Captain.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Find one.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
This is the end of the chase.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Excuse me.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Huh?
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Get me the Radio Tower!
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I like it fine here.
Not right now.
Yeah, boss?
Get up, damn you.
Do too much, I'll die.
No.
Fix raft first.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Then we've just got shit.
You?  Personally?
He's your cute thing.
And for you --
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
There isn't any us.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
A few things came up.  Or went down.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
I had to come.  To be sure you were okay.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Anything else?
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
That's why you're a gambling man.
I braided them.
That's all there is.
No sweat.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
You weren't dreaming about me.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
At least you were never lonely.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
It will be okay.
He's *paralyzed*!
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I never said they were boring.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Actually, I volunteered.
I guess so...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Almost.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
I don't follow.
It's Alfonse. I want to settle up. I haven't been ducking you. I told you I'd get it.
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Gee... What makes you say that?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
So we go to the bar.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
So what? We hide, right?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
She's up for it.
I have a good crew.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I can't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
I'll worry about Customs.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
It's what I do. It's my job.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Intuition.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
You better get over to Al's. Now.
I'm getting a ride.
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Where the hell is she?
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
With identification.
Of what? They're both crooks.
What?
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
All men are cheats.
You called the casino a cesspit.
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Seven-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
You want me drunk?
I. sold the car.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
What?
No.
The debts.
Do you believe in astrology?
That's fine.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Who's they?
What ten thousand pounds?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Jack.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
Any exceptions?
They've been tested.
You won't. Not without permission.
What for?
Bruised.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
It didn't go off.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Of course.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
In a second.
-- Remark.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
No?
How I make my living, what's your point?
That's not why we're here.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
You're not still pissed?
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I ain't mad at you...
I'll make it worth your while.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Mommy, where are you?
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Who is...
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
It was open.
You got a lotta nerve.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
How do I know you didn't?
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
How well do you remember the lab?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
I already don't like the sound of this.
But she does work here?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Let go of my hand.
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Yeah.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
So are dogs.
And she bought that?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
But I'll take a rain check...
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
--a philandering pig.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's sick.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
Huh?
No, I mean... you love your son?
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
One more time in English.
Curly.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
But, mom!
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
Look, you can have my wallet...
It's not nearly enough, punk.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
I'm not following you.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
Fuck them.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Will you go with me?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
What's wrong with you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Do they know yet?
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Where are you going?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
How so?
Yes.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
What did you find?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
I think now that he might...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Raspberry.
She's right over there.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yes, Leslie!
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
You could be quiet.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Gladys! Stop it!
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Nothin' too showy!
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
What kind of a dog is he?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
She did.
I can't do it...
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
It must be done right away.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Give me that again!
You worm!
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
This is terrible!
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Well, yes.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I feel much better. Thank you.
You've never been?
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
No, but I certainly shall.
Yes.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
John... Merrick
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Yes! The workhouse!
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Welcome home, John.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
But surely you know...?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What was she like?
I'll bring it back.
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
You've got to let me go!
Why?
Don't talk nonsense.
Sh!
I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Ah.
Oh, thanks.
Why?
Don't you FEEL it?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
She got me thinking...
Why should WE care?
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Vanish into thin air?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
No, I'm not.
Got you!
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
YOU do it!
I'm drowning! Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Helpless...
You liar!
Me too.
And something to sharpen them with?
And keep your sword greased.
I never do...
Sweetie, we called the company.
You did? You liked me?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I like it.
I can't remember.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Okay.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
Yeah.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Um --
Very much.
I don't know.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
No, I'm okay for now.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I think so.
Yes.
When?
It's three.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
Well, you're married.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I think we should go.
What if you stay this time?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm nervous, too.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I can't stop thinking about you.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
Your dried cum.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Yeah.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'kay.
Where?
Shit!
Do you swear you didn't know?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
What is Debbie's position?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
I think I found something...
Coop, where are you...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Run!
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
Hear what?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
A power drain --
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Starck, you still showing those readings?
Frozen.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
That's what we're here to find out.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
I don't know.
The "Other Place," what is that...?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Yes, sir.
Dr. Weir...!
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Come around to three-three-four...
But you can breathe it.
No. It was someone else.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Do you know what it was?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
I'm trying, goddammit --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
I can't believe we built this.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
It wants me. I have to go.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
You'd never know it.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I had it at four.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Go back to the drawing board.
And they're changing into...
They're not costumes.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
And that's a good thing?
Passion.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
You were?
Why didn't you say something?
Sure.
Reed, we're running out of time.
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Skeptical...?
Of course.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why?
See you later.
Okay, Dennis.
Yes, sir.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Well...
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
No. Are you crazy?
Get going.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Ace the jacket.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Fine. Get lost.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
That's me, Merv.
They're fuckin' with us.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
He was hot, wasn't he?
Believe it.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Well I never did it.
It was nice.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Sometime?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I don't know.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
The point sounds fine.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
No. I mean back to your home.
I've heard that, too.
Aren't your parents asleep?
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Awake? What do you mean?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
WHAT?
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Not down in my parts.
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
Jesus! Did I say that?
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why what?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
Us?
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Where'd you get this?
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Never missed a plane yet.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
You gotta be with me on this.
Yep.
The girl's got rhythm.
What?
Huh?
What?
Two.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Gimme the keys.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
No shit.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Am I too heavy for you?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
GO-GO-GO!!
I admire your strength.
What did we say about lying?
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Who's this?
Thank you --
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I'm not!
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
I gotta go now.
All square, Doc.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
But I'll never win that.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Were you a drug addict?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Daddy!
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Address?
They'll mend.
What is this?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Enh.
What?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Came to get a tan.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
Beats me.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
How did I look?
Well... you're looking well.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
...You will.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Not long.
I'll be back.
At one. Promise?
Mama...?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Huh?
No!
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Then why weep for him?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
How did you find me?
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Friend?
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
It's been months. It's not like him.
I should go. I should leave today.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Only you.
Not as weak as I.
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
It is
Now husband and wife.
Oh God.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Quite a few.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
How much longer?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
I owe you that. Done.
Victor, explain yourself.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Right! Right!
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
It sounded like Brenda.
Wet. I don't know.
Oh, you...
Let's go back, Barry...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
I don't believe you...
Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
Don't call him.
I call it my shower dream.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Jacob.
How'd she die?
You best better get it done, Pops.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
What are you going to do?
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Kate, Scott?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Yeah, we got a bible.
-- you got your shower --
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Cops.
She's in the other room.
Seth, if you were me --
Yes.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
We are?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
No problem, lieutenant.
Who's...  Lieuten --
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Of course, but there's more --
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
Sir?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Is this my glory, sir?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I don't know, I don't care.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
You got anybody, Wick?
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
Just askin'
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
This ain't even workin' wrong!
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
The first female President?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
You made a mistake.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Yeah, well...
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
And you think this creature is one of them?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
Five bucks.
Call me Charlie.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I don't think so.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
You're standing on it.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Sounds like a big company.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
Oh.  Okay.
Brandon.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Shit! Go!
That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
We're getting major structural damage.
It's fractured...
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Your last name.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
Wh... Where are we?
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
I hope I never have to believe that.
I?  You all know my history.
That can't be.
That you would have known you can trust me.
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
George!  So good to be back!
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Surely you knew this was coming.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Everything.  If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family.  We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
It is; we need you George.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
That land belongs to the strongest.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
You're kidding me, right?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
Calm down, Bear...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
You're right.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
Your who?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
What about her?
She's... young.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
What?
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I'm working on a few things.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Leo, I don't know.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Never heard of him.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
What've you got?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
That's what I'm doing.
I know what a marker is.
Fuckin' basketball game.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Not really.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
One of his best parts.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Twenty seven hundred.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
How? By taking my money?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Yeah. Right.  Listen, "Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?
What do you get out of it?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
Pick 'n' Save.
You seem to feel fine about it.
And after all, you have such morals.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Gimme a break.
Oh yeah.
If you get it back in one piece.
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
Hard to say.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Yeah, yeah.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Murphy.
Conveniently enough for you.
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
I bet you did.
That's what I call a payday.
Better than starving to death.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Only way to be.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
I don't know, are we?
What happened.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
What do you say, Dodge?
You got that right.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Maybe.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Fifteen, at the most.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
YES.
Are you still looking for a job?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
I didn't check my messages...
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
No.
You need counseling.
How long have you been up?
Why not?
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
What? Why?
That lets us off the hook.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
You loser!
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Everybody's too stupid!
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
I don't believe you.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Anthony's II!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
You're gross.  See that guy?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
What thing?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
Just some people from work...
I said "great"...
That's all you're bringing?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Tell me what?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --
Yes.
Did you bring that tape?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well are --
I don't think so...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
"Yet."
What? Why?
What, like a girdle?
That's the spirit!
Really?
Hi, it's me...
Sounds good...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
No, of course not.
...What do you mean?
I had to see you.
What's up?
Jesus, how can you stand her?
I hate sports.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I-I-I...
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
She's not at home?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
So work must be going well?
Then we agree. 
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Only in life... 
I'll be bait alone?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Since his beard was red.
They will want a lot of money.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Oh no.
No.  Not that I can recall.
I won't.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Okay, let's take a look.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Ghostbusters.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Okay.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I don't even want to know where that is.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Something good --
No, the slime is rising.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
I'll get one more reading.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Are you sick, Louis?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
Don't scream.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
That's so romantic.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
See!  They are using drugs.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
What do we do now?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
Where are you, Pete?
How do you know?
Mmmhmmm.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Not yet, dear brother...
Do you want posters, too?
Gladly Caesar.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
So am I.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Why you?
Sneaking around with your brother?
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Tomorrow?
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I killed too many barbarians.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Was I?
Yes.
Where is the car?
All right.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes.
With a family?
You sure you really want to?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Because I want to know what's happening.
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Ah. Where?
How could you do that, Benjamin?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
No.
But Elaine --
I have to go back now.
Oh no. He said that.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
Thank you.
Not exactly.
Ahhh.
No, sir.
Benjamin?
I'll be there in an hour.
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
What?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
But it's light in there now.
Please.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
No.
Jesus Christ!
I haven't. No.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Yes.
The number.
Okay.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute.
Anything. Anything at all.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Neither.
I don't.
He's asleep.
About five years.
Don't tell Elaine.
Yes.
Why are you asking me all this?
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Because I don't want you to.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
I wouldn't know.
Now don't start this.
What?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Promise me, Benjamin.
I don't believe you.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No wait. Wait.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
We haven't.
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
I've got to go.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
No, it's not --
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I'd like to discuss this.
That what he says. Right?
Not now.
Yes, sir.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Really?
Money.
You live here?
Oh!
Nothing -- only to be here.
Because you love me -- you love me?
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
And then --?
And -- and --
Yes -- tired...
Just for a minute then.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
What?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
And what do you do -- now?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
For Vienna?
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Till then.
Then you know him?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
I've no luck.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
I did not ask your advice.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
What, Doctor?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Yes -- that --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes, of course, -- money!
Later?
Do you like me better?
Then you will please wait outside.
You pay me.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
Have you got it now?
It's urgent.
Yes.
I understand perfectly.
Of course -- of course. 
Insolent young cub!
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Take them back, Suzette.
Please.
You're discharged.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Have I kept you waiting?
No news yet?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son was in the hospital --
Motherhood.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Roy? He's always crying.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
You brought a case? Good.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Lead on.
Perk.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
How come?
No. And you have to be.
And Myra's stuff?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
At what?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
I can't. I just left home.
I am in school.
Roy? It this all we have?
What?
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Myra, I'm not following this.
And when he got serious?
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
Maybe I like it where I am.
What?
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
What?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Yes.
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
No.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
It's an option.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Will, sit down...
Yes.
Just get on the bus.
John, you can't help her now.
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Can I come in?
Then I'll get caught.
Yeah.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's always John.
Michael Meyers.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
What is it?
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Very insightful.
Why?  You interested?
What if it's Kara?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Danny!!!
God ... this can't be true.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
But surely Rogers isn't --
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
An old friend.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Hm?
Didn't recognize you.
Tell them yourself!
Go home!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
How do you know that?
I dunno.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You did?
You're an imbecile.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I've considered that.
We got to get another pilot.
To make an ass of yourself.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Hello.
Are you--do you--
Where's Mom?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
College?
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
England?
Where did you get the poison?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Can't it keep till morning?
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
Leave a tip.
It's Mom.
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Heaven.
Eighteen--  and a half.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
Disease?
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
I did?
Turn around?
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
Ram it up your ass!
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
What then?
It couldn't!
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Did you like it, dear?
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
Where's the bullet?
Load it for her.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Hundreds.
Poison.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Don Quixote.
The new hero is you.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
There was so much going on.
Alice is dead?
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Kid--kid--
A what kind of doctor?
That's an interesting piece of news.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Father's friend.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Then get him.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
I'm sorry.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Why would you do that?
He's not your son.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Not true.
Phooey.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Yes, we do.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
No, I don't.
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Are you going to stiff me?
That's cool.
Okay.
That's all you got, three girls?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Yeah.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Up front?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
How important do you think sex is?
Fuck.
They are the same.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
You wife isn't dead is she?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
What?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Where does he hang out?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Ratan!
Jake.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
You working in San Diego now?
Thanks.
Come again.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
We planted it.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Because if you are...
I'm a file clerk.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
No.
Well then.
She seemed yare to me.
Well...
What?
But what?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Is he all right?
You are the wisest person I know.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
I like you, Maude.
But they have.
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Well, they're my species.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Why?
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Huh?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Souvenirs?
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Frank.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
What's the matter with her?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
So you slept O.K.?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Story of my life.
Oh, right --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
From where??!!
I think that is its hand.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
I worry about you.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
-- should go back. Now!
I'm in charge. We go back!
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
Yes?
Goodbye.
Not from you.
Alone?
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Strong.
Yes, I --
Just take it slowly.
We're leaving.
Where's my father?
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Uh-huh.
It's just a puzzle box.
Many times.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
This isn't happening.
I don't want to see the dress.
Back from where?
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
There's very little I can do about it.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
O.K.
Please. I can't bear it...
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
What's wrong?
Steve.
Do you want me to come over?
Call me tomorrow.
You like?
Me like.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Finished?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
That's right. Cointreau.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
We're not all frigid.
It's not what I heard.
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
It's a fetish of mine.
What things?
Will you GO, damn you?
You gotta be kidding me.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
Ehh.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Terrific.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
What?
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
It's the new --
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
On Clark Street!
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Oh, hi.
Okay.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
It's Vince and Justin.
Hi.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
I think you know that.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Nevermind.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Great... That's great.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I don't have your number.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
It was kind of funny.
You know what I mean.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Yes, of course.
What?
Hi.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
It's true!
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Yes.  You?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Everything all right?
I knew this was going to happen.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Thirteen hundred.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
No, we...
Fuck off.
What's the name of your label?
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
He'd want to know about all this.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Carl Smith.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Probably.
Does Carl Smith?
I've been to Church Hill.
Where?
Dupont Circle.
And you?
I'd rather hear yours.
Go home.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You've been listening to rumors.
You are.  Now.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Is that a threat?
Damn you.
It'll never stick.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
What's all of this got to do with me?
Why?
Stop!
Your name is Conor?
How can you know this?
You're a long way from Inverness.
Yes.  Always.
I don't know why.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Certainly not me.
Romirez is dust.
So sure?
We need more time.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
How did you find me?
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
You're insane.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Your murder weapon?
Where were you Tuesday night?
He's mistaken.
His only kid.
The resemblance is amazing.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
What?
I'll come a-running, pardner.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
But --
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I'm beginning to realize that.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
You'll ask me to what?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
I notice you still remember it.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Sure you can. Come on.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
I'm not working for any other paper!
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
What's his line?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Where's some paper?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
What's that -- what's that?
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Who do you want?
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
What went off?
Yeah. But I --
If there was any way out...
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
I did.  Hold the wire.
Just -- one -- second!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
What did you do with her?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
No -- what?
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
I won't, Earl. 
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
How much do you make a week?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Very well, Grandpa.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Bugger off.
OK. You're in.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
Ask her yourself.
It's easy. I've done it.
That's not the point.
Well, for the baby, really.
It's like telling fibs.
They might be.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
Kiss me Hardy.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
The ideas you get in your head.
Or what?
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
We did the decent thing.
You might still have a house.
And now we're glad you did.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Come on.
OK.
You're welcome.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
You shouldn't a done that.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Lock the fucking doors.
There's not enough room.
I gotta open the gate.
What I need are some answers. 
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
So.
When?
Shhhhhh.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Recover any bodies?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Dr. Satan?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
Aw, fuck.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Oui, doctor, oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Oui. Perfect!
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Hmmmph.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
That's not how he tells it.
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Always. Ow.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Oh?
Three foot one.
Please, honey, let me in.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
As do I.
Where?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
I'm not sure.
Why certainly!
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
I don't know. Something.
I think he's feral.
He looks perfectly fine.
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
All right.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
No.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Have you?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Ummm. It's good.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yahoo!
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Check!
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
Soon as I finish my coffee.
Well, nobody has to sell.
That's the way it's done.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Deal the cards.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Sit down.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
What is?
I got drunk.
A thousand.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why?
For who?
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Where?
'Bout even.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Tell her what?
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Oh yeah? Where?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
By all means.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Who's he?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
You're a pretty good player.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Fine, thanks.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Fifth of scotch?
Why?
Okay. So what's your name today?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
You got it all in your head?
Oh, it's not bad.
No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
A loser?
Is he a winner?
Does it bother you? What he said?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
I feel pretty.
Come here. Come on, now.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
No.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
We move.  Place to place.
Where you lived with them.
Humans.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Please.
Let's check it out, Dad.
I was so scared.
Better now, son?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Where, Jimmy?
If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
I don't see anything.
No.
Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
What happened to your other slipper?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
What's his family background?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Huh? Oh, good, good.
You punched the President in the face?
I'm making a mess.
She should be shortly.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
We're already over Mach 2!
It's all fuzzy.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
I said call them back.
Air... water... your "sun."
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
You are on your own?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Yes. Now we know.
Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities.  Have a look over here. This might interest you.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
You said go between them!
You had it? You didn't trust me!
Don't know. Think of something.
You do.
It's important!
But what are you doing here?
Through the library?
Rats?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
Don't worry. He won't.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
What?
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
What evil?
Hey, he's not a waiter...
A SNAKE!!
First of all -- don't panic!
PET IT??!!
Keep stroking it!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
Dr. Jones?
No... the heart's still beating!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
So now they believe me.
Not quite.
And they don't even know what it really is.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
Me.
Al.
Your name is Al...
What street?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Loading a gun.
Are you crazy?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
The man.
I can't remember..
Nothing. You just do nothing.
We get on a plane.
Why not?
You leave my glands alone!
Swim.
Why not?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Not blue enough.
Why not?!
Maybe she's telling the truth.
What is it?
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
I don't know!
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
I can't keep up.
That's not funny.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone...
Just say the words. Just like I told you.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Where?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
Where've you been?
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
It's all we've got.
It'll remind me of you.
The best part. She'll love it.
What a nerve!
Me.
I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
Yes. Joe.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
How do I look?
Well what?
Don't you want to get out?
I feel fine.
I don't know Who.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
I noticed you staring.
Sir?
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
Me still. They left you alone?
You are.
You're talking to me.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
What's he done?
How do you know you can trust me?
Get your things.
And you?
How?
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
You coming along?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
I've never met anyone like you.
Yeah...I have to get away.
A drink...
Why not?
It is?
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
It'l be alright.
It will.
Instant rice...?
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
I'll take a look at what you got. But I'm not moving any deadlines 'cause you say so.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
...fuck is this? Fuck!
Maybe later.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
What about you, you got a crew already?
Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there.
Okay.  Lowell?
Yes, it's on the stove...
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
Yes... Jeffrey.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Yeah.
I have to take a shower.
Who is this?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Okay. Thank you.
No shit.
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
What I've seen... I've liked.
No. We don't do that.  You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America.
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
Good. I want to talk to you.
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals?
You believe that?
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
No. I mean since whenever...
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
What do you mean there is no family?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Poor communication skills.
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
What?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Yes?
Yes.
Ruth Rabino.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Isn't everything?
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
But you don't agree?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
Absolutely.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
No.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
I bet.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
I fell in love Miles.
You have some?
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
She did a Harriman.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
So what?
She's here now.
That's delusional.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Thank you.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Video.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She owes me a meal.
-- the coin?
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes, sir?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
No—no. What the deuce do I want to—
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
What've you got against King Westley?
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Yes, of course.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
No.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Here—take mine.
Must be the Spring.
Thanks, professor.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Yes.
I'm following you.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
What?
Uh-huh. Want one?
I hate the horrid stuff.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Congratulations.
—six—seven—eight—nine—
Left twenty minutes ago.
Sorry, Miss.
Isn't he here?
What's that?
Eight o'clock.
Yes.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Listen, Pal—you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.  A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Thanks, Joe.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.  Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it.
Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Why—no—
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
There were no phone records.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Not unless we go for Shaw now.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
What did they...
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
And then Sunday?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
There were admirals.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
A Perry Russo?
David Ferrie.
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did. It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job.  Lou, come alive.  These things are not adding up.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Are they?  Why would they?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
Ever ask him?
And he never hit you before?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
Do you walk home?
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Not a problem.
Oh, that's not a problem.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'll call her.
Go ahead.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
She knows it's my case?
Bet you're happy to be working again.
Is it dark?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
With ten thousand? Nine.
Cash poor?
Yeah.
Sure.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
How'd you feel about it?
Bigger?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
In a dress.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
Why?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I didn't say you did.
You'll get over that.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
I thought you were tired of your business?
I'm just tired in general.
Do you live together?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
You know what we want.
You talk to him?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Yes. All those things are true.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
But you didn't do that.
I thought you were watching him.
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Go sit over in that chair.
All your money's in Mexico.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I need to talk to you alone.
How do you know she did that?
Man, I don't like that part.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar In downtown L.A. till my man over here calls me and gives me the O.K. sign.
Susanville.
What for?
Fourteen.
Were you a disco girl?
We had done time together already.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Which one is for the car?
What do I do?
Whatcha watchin'?
I dunno.
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
What's your relationship?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
You shot her twice?
What?
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Where you shot her.
It's in there.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
Watcha gonna see?
They don't have your winning personality.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
It still sounds high.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Winston found you.
Well, give it to me then.
You expect me to just walk in there?
You better be, motherfucker.
I'll give you his beeper.
Where do you want to go?
Take me home.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
What isn't happening?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
No, don't. But thanks.
Me, too.
Oh God!
You're hurting me!
That's right. We did.
It's hard to explain.
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
It was the window.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
... I've seen them, too.
Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
We should get ourselves a lawyer.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What? By myself?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I don't want to know.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Go to sleep.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
I moved the couch. That's all.
What happened to you?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
A good lay.
What's in here?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
It's gone to the top.
What kind of man are you?
Lie down!
Here. I'll do it.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
In a way. At least now I have some idea of what was happening. If we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... I don't know. Maybe it'd clear things up in my head. I'll tell you something, Jez, honestly ... I thought they were real.
Let go!
I want to know. You tell me!
I can do anything I want.
Me neither.
It's so hard to believe.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
I don't know you.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
I'm tired.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Sit down, Jake.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Shows how much you knew.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
Never?
We're not going to hurt you.
What?!
Lennox Hospital.
Paul Gruneger!
I need to see you, Jake.
I need to see you.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
You in trouble?
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Is he all right?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
Could you show a little compassion?!
We don't have a choice!
Delongpre! Out of time!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Rizzo did.
Where'd you get the gun?
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Two more charges to go.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Oh man, what the hell happened?
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
Hey!!
Were you close to your father?
Not so bad.
Did you like it?
We're screwed.
He's right behind us!
That ought'a help the situation.
So what else is new?
You're leaving me here alone?
Later.
Barbie from hell...
You killed him?
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
Good point.
No! He's coming with us!
Keep trying!
Three...two...one...
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
You going to be all right?
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
Just keep kicking.
I can't imagine why.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Set?
Is that a boat?
He's busy.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Let me see your hands...
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
Ever see one like this?
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I don't think so.
Cool.
I'm supposed to be running.
Charisma?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Um, hi?
Huh?
Why?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
You know it's okay.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Did you hear it's yours?
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
I rock a Harmony.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Yeah.
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
Hey, I like this.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Uh, thanks.
What are you?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
God, you're so young.
Nothing.
Your name, please?
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Is this Juno?
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
That is sick, man.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
You sound shocked or something.
Hot!
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
A Pilates machine?
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
And I disagree.
Can you see it?
Have you found a place to stay?
It's a loft.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Yeah, sure.
So you don't do any of those things.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Took 'em all.
Early, you are so sweet.
Vernon, Florida.
No sir.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
This guy killed a mess of people.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
A... I gotta go.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
I still think we should have met them first.
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
I'm finished.
You're clean.
Now you gotta be careful.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
To what? Virgins?
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Are you hungry?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Right.
Yep.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
So.
Yeah probably.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
Right here.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Nothing?
I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
Here. Swallow.
Why?
Do you care about me?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
But I only had sex with Telly.
Yeah.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I gotta find him.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
Do you know where he went?
Because he can like climax you up to that...
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Shh.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
It's grandmother style.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
What are you saying?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
How'd you get in here?
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Then what's he talking about?
I'm positive.
What's the first street?
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
You think he's dirty?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
You alright?
It's a voice modulator.
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Why not?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Let me speak to my daughter.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
Boys.
No... but I can tell.  A woman knows these things.
My cheering section.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Nothing.
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
What about the way he arranged the body?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
I went out.
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
I want to be the best I can.
About what?
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
She could be dead now.
It wasn't intentional.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
That's not fair!
You're not?
Alright.  What about me?
She died in a car accident.
No.
Then why are you backing up?
Where's the note?
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
All the passages are guarded.
I don't know how.
I won't leave you here.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
What will happen?
I ache with it.
You will follow me.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
To the place where Death lives.
I'm all right.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
You do?
I'd wish for a puppy.
I only want one.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
We have plenty of hares.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
No. He will master the leader.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A fine match.
With an old voice?
Many have perished in that maze.
She has the power of vision.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...What?
Yes.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
No.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
A little...
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Huh, that's good!
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
No... Dino's.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
You have?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
You don't think I love you?
There's no reason.
Yes.
Pacifica, California.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
That's all right isn't it?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Nine.
The Gazette's small huh?
It has to be a full character's name.
What, come on?
Hello.
Water?
Water.
Hello.
Yes, that's right.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Can we just forget it?
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Yuri... are you...
But it's a top three school --
Are we done for today?
You're fired. I have new representation.
I believe you! Don't worry.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
No, she'd stashed it by then.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Thank you.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
What'd you do?
Definitely! I love him!
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Uh -- family.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
What?
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You guys are so sweet!
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
No, she can't move for an hour.
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
You're serious?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
What do you think?
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I don't know --
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
You got into Harvard Law?
What, like it's that hard?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
See?
Really?
Chuck.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
Where's the Rock?
Cunnilingus?
Yeah, luckily.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Fire moat... why do that?
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
Do it now!
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Cathay?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Faerie ring?
I fear she's lost.
Don't you know?
Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
Knaves and robbers...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Track the demon to his lair.
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Jack, don't!
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
What magic have we on our side?
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
I don't... understand.
Patience, lad.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
Nay.  Jack's the dragon-slayer, ain't you, Jack.
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What's the matter?
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I'm not its master.
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
Its powers are strong.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
Not very precise directions.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
And am I not fair?
Jest with me then.
How so?
And as barren of love as stone.
Be fair, Oona.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
In a dream.
We did a lot of the wiring too.
I couldn't sleep last night.
No.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
Why are you so stupid?
Does everything have to have a point?
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Are you afraid of heights?
You'd hate him for the trick.
I don't wanna go.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
A violation?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
I flushed it down the toilet.
How old are you?
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
I did warn you.
Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
To check up on me?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Oh, okay.
A friend of yours is here.
Did you got through my pants?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
Try it.  It feels good.
How do you become something you're not?
What are you now?
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Can you build a house in four months?
I haven't been touched in years.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I want you to find someone for me.
You let him pierce his nose?
A blueprint spool.
The garage.
When's school over?
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Finished or unfinished?
You're not well.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
This was my very first slow dance.
What did he say?
No.
Don't even...I'm there.
I wasn't sure.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
His father is a man.
We should take a vacation.
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
I never asked for more.
I'll be in the bedroom.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Dad said it first.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
But you can't.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Take care of me?
Yes, boss.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
You went to Monroe?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
What are you talking about?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
You know what I'm saying.
Forget it.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Crop duster.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
Back to New York for starters.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
You ever done time before?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Anybody else need anything read?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
All right. Let me out.
Don't do it!
You want a queen? Got one right here.
An angel?
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
That pain is hunger.
Put it in your mouth.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
You got it.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Andrew.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
You have a dog? What kind?
Good. I was concerned.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
From my dad's side of the family.
Up there.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Just wondered... what happens?
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Please... No.
Sad? What made you sad?
No.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
You're sure you don't want to try?
Of course.
Then it's still no.
About running, dying what?
It's different now. Help me.
How can I?
Some people say children need human mothering.
Muscle? I don't know that one.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
I -- I can't.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
I won't.
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
I don't know.
I don't know... but it does.
They're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
Where are you going?
Oh, my...
Hello.
Do you want to see Doc?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Not yet.
Alive?
Oh, yes... I think...
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I'm sorry.
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Anybody else have a key to the house.
Or not so recently?
Hi.
I can't see you tonight.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Sure.
Okay.
No... no.
Pornos.
Yeah.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Yeah. Call him.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes.
Alice?
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Sure.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Yes.
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
No... Here he comes.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
He didn't come home.
I don't know yet.
I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
No.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
No, no. I want to go in.
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
A videotape.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
No, nothing.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Yeah?...
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You were acting like a different person.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Yeah.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
A paleontologist.
I beg your pardon.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Sounds like a stall to me.
They were in a quandary, and—
Come on, Lovey.
Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
It's unbelievable.
Think of it! In times like these.
Gold. You were going to—
No.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
He amputated his own leg?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me!  Go on, beat it. Beat it!
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
How can we get in touch with them?
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
What do you mean if we should get out?
Let me go, Bob!
Chang! Chang! Chang!
All right. Sorry, George.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
What's she got to do with it?
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
Come on! We're wasting time!
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
What do you suggest?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Yes, I know.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I was just going to.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Hesitated, sir.
Cowan--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
I guess I lost:
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
You don't know me at all.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
A what?
There's a god damn good reason.
How does that help me?
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
All of it?
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Actually, you may have.
Why not?
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
So... how did they get here?
And I'm bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
This guy.  Where was he?
Scientific American?  Really?
Come again?
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Did it leave?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
She grew up.
She's still alive?
Whatever you say, John.
Kill type?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
The nation votes this week...
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Yes.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
Flaws.
Oh... Hi, John.
Well, hello there, honey-pie.
You gotta have faith, Dad.
What the hell.
Oh, Sean --
Once I even told him I loved him.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
You say some of the children died?
What safe place is that?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Lamar --
Tell him not now.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Yes.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We used to, every summer.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
I haven't seen him in two years.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
So?
What, sir?
Somebody's getting comfortable.
Should I fuck him?
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
I'm ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Yeah? You sure?
Go.
Your dance is over.
Yeah.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
She was fast, huh?
Ruiz knows about this?
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yeah.
Yes. Goodbye.
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Ricky's taken care of.
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Any time, bro.
Thanks.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
Seat belt.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
I don't know.
Nah, don't bother --
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
No. Look. There.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
I told you what they said.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
You too?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
He wants to see us now.
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
You want us strapped, don't you?
Did you hear what he just said?
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I'm pretty sure we do.
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Cool.
Drinks are free, right?
It means you got a gun?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Watch it...
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
You think it's funny, motherfucker?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
We're going to New York?
But, Max --
Yes, sir.
I am.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Yes, sir.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Just now.
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I'll give you back the 600.
Let Billie finish.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I want to. God knows I want to.
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
How do you like it?
I can handle it.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
We need you too!
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
What did I tell you about assuming?
What color were the original Hebrews?
What?
The sentences to run concurrently.
I mean it's late, baby.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Please make way, please --
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
You're too small to be Bogart.
I'm not too short to be Cagney.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
That's right.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
No.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
So where do we begin?
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Who ordered it?]
[Where do I find him?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Yes.
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I'm sorry.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Frank. Frankie.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
You do?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
Two tourists who never went home.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Yeah, sure.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Where you going?
We just talked.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
It pains that they should do this.
Who?
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Thank you.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Marty...
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
No...
Okay.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Sure.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
No, I'm not kidding.
I'll see you.
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Sure. This girl said...
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
What didn't you like about her?
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
I don't wanna talk about it!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
What the hell's going on here?
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Duke Forrest.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Shore Patrol, Duke. Let's go!
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
Same here. You can retire my number.
I have a tent to myself.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
I found a doner.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
An eternal damnation.
And all the angels are built like Lieutenant Dish.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
What's the age of consent in this country?
Not necessarily.
All of them?
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
They missed the boat.
Save that crap for the rest of the clamdiggers back home.
What's wrong with him?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
Oh, get out of here!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Good morning.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
He likes you well enough to stick around.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
No.
Who?
No.
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Yeah, that's the one.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, sir.
No, no, no—that's your seat.
All set, Ann?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
John Doe.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Did you find her?
Both of 'em?
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah. That's—that's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Four bits.
John Doe Club?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
I want it as soon as possible.
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
You're my hero.
Dinner's on you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
I'll take half of your action.
How can I help you with the particles?
Is there a problem?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
How do you feel after a shooting.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
I'm not sure.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
Get good at it.
To save lives.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
The jockey!
We lost.
And doing a very good job of it.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
My name's Scott Roper.
You worship yourself.
You heard.
You think I didn't need you?
And it's hard to get.
...Let me just show you.
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
The car is part of the deal.
To live forever.
This is how you pick up women --
From the dream.
True.  But why?
No.
In here I am.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
What about the customers with reservations?
Go!
And you weren't involved.
Why?
Then where is she?
Insurance?
Who are you?!
I know.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Speed?
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
... Let's take a look over there.
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
Ryan's Comet!!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
Did I say anything?
What do you mean "basically"?
Strength in numbers!!
And I ain't no nigger either!
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
Minimum security. You'll have everything but broads.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
No. Not everything.
What do you mean?
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
No. They envy you.
For what?
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Seein' he loved the experience so much, I think we outta give him the pleasure again.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
But that's an hour's drive.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
I found that out.
They do what I tell 'em.
Not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
The Big Picture.
So change it.
A peaceful and prosperous retirement.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Come on. Be polite.
Hell. It's been four days!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Five CC's.
Olive or eyeball?
Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
He called me "Doc."
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
When'd you get in?
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
And you don't deal drugs?
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
You want to come inside?
How are you doing sweetheart?
What pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
What does he do?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
It couldn't be.
Let's send out a pigeon!
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Yeah. What about the second act?
That's taking place outside now.
I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Paine.
"There's more light here," he says--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Yeah.
Any time.
Tonight?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Oh! Go away.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Yes. Come in.
Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
Why, of course.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Jefferson--
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
What?
J-Jefferson Smith.
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
You *couldn't*?
Tonight.
Good. Where are we?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
And a *lot* of paper!
He did?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Terrible, thank you.
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Thanks a lot.
Wow!
Are you drunk?
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
Wonderful!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Splendid.
Well! You don't say!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
How's that, buddy?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
You won't stand for it?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Order!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What happened?
What?
Oh, I don't mind.
Uh-huh.
Oh, that—
You have?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
No, I don't mind.
A girl?
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Hello.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
Have lunch.
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
John—
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Me sir?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
He's not home, I tell you!
Nuisance value?
What was that you said he was?
But your honor—
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
Why, no.
When?
Yes. That is to say—
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.  If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Arthur wants to quit!
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
They can have the Estate.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Oh, Mr. Deeds—
What kind of wife did you say she was?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Take the stand!
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Excuse me. What did you say?
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
One hundred books?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Were you supposed to have a session?
Right now?
Stop now.
My pleasure.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
What do you want to know?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
You're on your own today, honey.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Got a license?  But no car?
You're good.
That would explain it.
Mumford... like the town?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Really? What would it take?
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Of course.
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Sofie...
What?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
It's a big part of the show.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days.
Is that the question?
I've got three big ones.
This is exactly what I wanted.
She's probably ten years older than you.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
It's just a thought.
A doll?
No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
What about everything? How did this happen?
It wasn't the best situation.
Did you carry a gun?
You and Candy...?
See you Thursday... regular time.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
You want my advice? Far out!
Wow.
Yep.
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
Priests. Imhotep's priests.
You're not going to kill us?
Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
Sounds familiar.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
Exactly --
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
Correct, And that's when --
To be hanged.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
Broad?!
I just decked your brother
No, I mean --
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Because that's my name.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
It's everybody's problem!
I'm staying.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Oh.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Fantasizing... about you.
One last tweak.
When was that?
I was eight.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
Let's do it.
Doctor Heller?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Ummm.
They always call the great ones nuts.
Are you with me... or against me?
You underestimate yourself.
Sure -- I guess.
Curiosity.
Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
Date?
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
Roy.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
But I just don't feel it.
Or flowers.
Wait!... Look!
Well they've crawled back out.
Anybody got any?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
Or Batman --
The who?
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
Whatever our name is.
It's suicide.
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I am.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne, please.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Ah-hh, no.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
Oh?
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
Thank you.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
To Citizen General Bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife.  You should know, Citizen General, that your wife has taken a lover, one Captain Hippolyte Charles... undated and unsigned.
Junot?
And you, Junot?
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
She must have been in love with you.
I will never forgive you.
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
There's probably some explanation.
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
You wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes.
Yes, I do -- very much.
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Is he alone?
Show him in.
Let me have it.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
That's it?
You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?
Yeah.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Not me.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
What you mean, so?
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
That ain't gonna work.
No.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
What about me?
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I just wanted to give you this.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
He's a boy, dude.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
I got fired too.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
I don't know.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
I've been a bad boy.
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
What?
I would also like to apologize.
Yes.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
I will do no such thing.
Of course you're invited. You're a big donor to the campaign. They love you.
No, please...
Forget about it.
Right.
I know you do, honey.
It's a twenty.
Cover your mouth.
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Yeah.
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
It's time. It's time now.
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
I'll bet.
Dad, you're bleeding...
And I won't never tell about the money.
When'll the skiff be ready?
How's your sister Pearl?
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
She went.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
About what!
A man of the Cloth?
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. Never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
The Blue Men?
Sshhh...
Hm?
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Is that all?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Yes. Yes.
That wasn't very nice of you, John. Have a heart, boy.
I don't know nothin'!
I'll tell.
Yonder.
I'll tell you a secret.
Yes?
Yes?
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Can I have this?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
What's wrong, John?
Them kids!
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
When did I ever?
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Used to. Not anymore.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Just want to talk to him a second.
Sure, but...
Get into bed.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Right.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
We should get her out of here...
Of course. What's that?
What is it, Anna?
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Or we can't go back to Russia!
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
What is it?
How many families live here with you?
No, no.
Yes, Comrade.
But, Comrades...
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Good morning, Gaston.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Have you?
Yes.
Thank you, Louis.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
It's a real Paris reunion.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Business.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Yes. Could you give me some information?
You might hold this for me.
How long does it take a man to land?
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Is that customary?
And what do you do for mankind?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It's twelve o'clock.
It's false sentimentality.
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
What are you after?
Why?
At what?
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Did you make any change in this room?
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
No. Nobody will find us.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
Who cried that one?
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
They belong to the people.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana.
Yes, Swana, you did.
How do you do?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
I must ask you to leave.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Yes, it does.
Please... sit down.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
The future of the common people.
At Père Mathieu's.
My jewels?!
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
What?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
Yes ... I got the money.
I'll bet he would.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
You think this is just about politics?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
I don't have a pistol.
Cox!  Fire him.
I know it well, sir.
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
It's the parents' fault really.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
When I met with him, he said ...
Why me?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
Yes ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
You should ask Bobby.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
She's quite pretty.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
What I think is ... they're cowards. Their opposition represents the cowardice of the Eastern Establishment.  They don't realize as you do, Mr. President, that the Communists only respect strength, and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the "madman," Richard Nixon.
Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
That depends who writes the history books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want.  But they won't get it.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
That'll be the day.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Yes, yes.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
It's over, Dick.
Not that.  Us.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
I've missed you.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
When?
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How's that?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
I am older.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
In Angola. Yeah.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Yes.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
Some pretty bad people.
Yes ma'am, I do.
Mm.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
That's very nice.
Well. If you say so.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I ain't got the money.
...I need to sit down.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
At the gettin' place.
Goin' out.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes I do.
Uh-huh.
I can hear it in your voice.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Step out of the car please, sir.
In the truck.  I'll get it.
No me mate.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
With anything?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
How's that?
Uh-huh. Double ought.
You already have the tent?
November the 28th, last year.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
That's not an answer.
Okay. We can stop that.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
Yes.
I got an overcoat on.
Are you jackin' with me?
Don't jack with me.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Oww! My arm, careful!
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You think a woman did that?!
Bad idea...
Junior year!
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
What about it?
"Banners?"
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
...I... I know what you are.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Didn't I?
Yes... maybe it was.
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
What's so special about it?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
What?
Make sure it's elevated...
Sure I loved it! It was great.
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
No, almost never.
Where are you going?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Good.
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Huh?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
That is so right.
Hell of a way to die.
I hope you're right...
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I don't know, George...
Blah -- blah -- blah... Hurry up, will ya, I got a date tonight...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Did Chloe crack?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Powas p'suasion.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence -
Yes, but honey -
That wasn't my doing...
It was in his bureau.
Million point two.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write.
Okay, okay. You win.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Yes, sir!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is your brother a flyer?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Yeah... Mmmm...
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
What do you mean?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
Do you go to school?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
There's always a choice.
That's it?
It sure was.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Your real father?
Why'd he do it?
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
I can't risk it.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
He said he grew up poor?
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
Yeah.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
But she expects you to marry her?
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Peace out.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
NOT THAT ONE?!
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
I did.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
What about us?
Adios.
What do you want?
You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
Open it.
I said open the door.
No fucking way.
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
What?
I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Don't.
It doesn't work?!
I heard you.
"Titanic."
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
No.
What?
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Okay.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
You got it. Berkeley?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Yes sir, I did.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Alone...
You fit the profile, Brother. You look exactly like the kind of nigger they think they can trust...
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
No, he takes after his mother...
He's my father.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
My pleasure, sir.
Colonel will do.
Oh?
That one is a bit more difficult.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Perhaps.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Probably.
Yes.
Oh?
Flanking riders?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
And what do they know?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
You don't hate him.
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
Thirteen years...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
What are my orders?
It is ended.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Goodbye, Harry.
And what is the second thing?
But father, they might come this way.
And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ayuh.
Well...I guess not.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes--
Yaay!
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Yaay!
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Yeah, sure.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
What were you listening to?
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
Yes.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Then come on.
What?
This babe has said enough.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You don't understand--
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
That boat is my livelihood!
I will.
Aye, aye, sir!
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Wait as long as you like.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
What're you suggesting?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
Not as a condition -- a request.
What?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Exactly.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
You would do that?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
On what?
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
You've seen it?
You haven't seen it.
Speak.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
Don't be a child, Icarus.  She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
I like Trix!
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Why don't you just shove it up your ass!  Haw-haw!
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
Okay.
Really?  What have you been doing?
We'll see?  What does that mean?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
The nanobot.
Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
Why?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
No cheese.
Like a glove.
On the counter.
You're not going back to jail.  All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
That's right.
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
Oh yeah?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Yes - Sing Sing.
Exactly.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Stewart!
That's ridiculous.
You're acting like a child.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
Thanks, I will.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
Araby?
I'm not quitting!
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Quite so. Quite.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes.
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
—and those and them.
Not since you broke into society.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
There you are—!
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
What could I be?
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
I suppose you know why I came—?
I don't eat waffles.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
And now for that twentieth crack—
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Are the cars ready?
Have you seen this? 
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yeah?
Sure.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
Looks just like it did.
Here's my favorite.
Oh, George ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Sure you are.
I don't want it to go away.
Where are you gonna go?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
You want to get out of here?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Yes.
What are you doing?
YOU get lost!
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
He won't notice anyway.
Jen please ...
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
It's fine.
Sure.
Nothing?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
I told you. I'm like positive.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
It was a prop for the school play ...
I like it too.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Excuse me?
Look ...
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Why don't you just take me back without it?
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Yeah ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Really?
Just a little--You know.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I'm sorry.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What?
I have no idea.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Tell me why.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Sure.
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
I know but I....how much is it?
Really? Please?
No. I'm sorry.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
I didn't lie.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
I saw a picture of you.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Sure.
Ok.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....yeah....
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Nothing.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Thank you.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm fine are you ok?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
You're hand is bleeding.
On my knife.
I didn't know you had a sister?
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Mhm.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Hi.
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What do you have in the house?
Is this where you live?
Nothing.
You can't be late.
You can't be late though.
I know.
Don't puss out.
Yes, yes, right.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
It's fine.
So...did my brother call you?
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Once or twice.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
Mightier than the sword indeed.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
And his writing?
Yes?
Shut down?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
Come now, darling, give it a read.
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Don't
How much?
I will not defend my life to you--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
Not for me.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Yes?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Telling stories.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
But with compassion and insight--
The old man has his own way of doing things
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Oh Christ
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Again
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Please don't ask me to do this.
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Happy birthday.
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
We're from...
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
None of your fuckin' business.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Jack! Enough!
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You wasn't with her?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Where you been?
Well, that's what I mean.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
What?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
But you said "you."
So what?
Does that mean...
Three more, I figure.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
It feels real good.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Can you see it?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What did I do?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You did?
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
Jake --
Never felt better.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Right, the gym.
Excuse me for living.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
That's what they call a family problem.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
Do that.
-- until yesterday morning.
A detective's nightmare.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
For getting rid of that cast.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
You did.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
Yeah. Is that you, Jeff?
Who are you?
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
I'm not ready for marriage.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
You can tell that from here?
Smart girl.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Mrs. Doyle?
You haven't even heard from him?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
That's good news.
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
I mean what I said.
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Something too frightful to utter.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
To get on home.
Not yet!
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Your name?
Phone number?
What?
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
Hold it, Jim.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!  Shh!
Yes.
What would you do, Dad?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sure.  Sure.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I think I know my son.
He's just loaded, honey.
Just relax, please relax!
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I still think you should go down.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Do you hear from him, son?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
He has a knife.
What?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
I'm what?  What?
Not lately.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
You sure?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
All right, darling.
Goodbye, dear.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Good Lord!
No.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Mess that kid up?
So then you moved?
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
No--I was just--maybe--
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
What?
We were romantic then too--
Why?
NO!
No, baby. He wants me.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
What.
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
JESUS CHRIST!
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
No!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
We? What "we"...
Nick...
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I never told you my name.
Yes!
I never worked at no casino.
She says a lot of things.
Wish I had a brother like you.
The hell you don't.
Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Don't tip.
Ash?
Leave the tree.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Show's over.
I don't know... what you're...
That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
She set them up. All of them.
You gave them me.
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
You ain't dying, he is.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
How do you know all this?
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Bullshit.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Yeah.
How can you tell?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Traffic tickets gone to warrant. They stopped him for something, found the warrants on 'im, took 'im to jail. She doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed. Well, I don't wanna do this, I have a bad feeling about it, but she keeps askin' me, keeps askin' me, finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to it. Well, we're picking this guy up at the train station.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Dead as Dillinger.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
You do?
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Correct.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
You really think we were set up?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
What?
No shit?
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
That fuckin did it!
So you wanna git bit, huh?
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
This is what he was doin'.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Nobody. The light was bad.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
Where do you keep the can opener?
Yeah.
We can't stay here!
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Will she be dark or fair?
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Maybe they will.
Goodbye, Mary.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Why?
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
Nice.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
At the ranch maybe?
And meet him there.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Kind of sore.
All right, you didn't know.
All right, you didn't know.
What's there to be fair about?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
It isn't that --
Yeah.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Don't you even know your letters?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
But you're his brother.
Let me do that.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
I found a picture of his wife.
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
That's it.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Would you die already?!
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Listen to me I --
Thanks, I'll be fine.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Both of them?
This can't be happening?
My child, you're alive!
Huh?
Hey, I got an idea.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Any of them hot?
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
What?
"Ray!"
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
0h, shit!
No more violence... No more violence...
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Why?
Let me see!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You mean for TV or print?
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
You bring me such peace...
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Who is this?
COCKSUCKER! 
It's not fair!!
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
There is one big problem though.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
How to send a bill!!
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Let's get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
Why?
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -—  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him —— white —— and the men holding him up between them.
But you have treated me that way.
Who the devil is he?
What things? Why?
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
I know —— I shouldn't have told you—
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I'm afraid.
And you believe that?
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said -— it fits in with what I saw -— she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I'd forgotten.
It might have.
I can imagine. But you did say you came to me as my friend --that you were concerned for me.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
No, she's with her sister,
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
She's not been here for a long time.
Of course.
Please.
What?
When?
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Oh. Well, please sit down.
No. Why?
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Why is that?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Not really.
No.
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
To you?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
That's correct.
Don't you get lonely?
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
I... I can't answer that precisely.
I don't know. Possibly.
Not entirely.
Yes.
Possibly.
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
I want out of this marriage.
Yes!
Yes.
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
What do you mean?
Did you do anything?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Is he still at your house?
What do you mean, like physically?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Yes.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Will you stop? Jesus.
Fine.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I can't believe you did that!!
Did you take your clothes off?
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
And you ask questions, right?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Just a moment.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Were you disappointed?
Yes.
Different.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
You're intrigued?
You are scum. I'll be there.
Right.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I just... Ann is very...
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
It'll just be me.
You have family here also?
So is my wife, asshole!!
Shut up!!!
Brian Kirkland, please.
He said immediately.
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Sure.
You knew these people?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
That's the one.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
Of course.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Time to check with Flavors.
You got it!
I got it!  I got it!!!
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Of course.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
F for...
I don't think he intends to go that far.
CRIMINAL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
You guys having fun?
I love you.
Gary.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
I just remember you jogging. So when's the wedding?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Good. How're you?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Now we're talking.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Beautiful.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
With Maya?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
I'm fine!
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Nope.
Is what the money thing?
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
What's up?
Thanks.
Keep it elevated.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Me?
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
You need a new car anyway.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Well...
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Yeah.
Victoria.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
That's great.
About a year.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
You don't even know what that word means.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
I see.
How can you say that?
Ray Reddy's house.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
Got it!
I have some upstairs.
They tell you everything in this book.
What's two?
You're scaring your sister.
It's like War of the Worlds.
There's nobody coming?
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
They've been kind to me.
This is a brutal land.
It's one thing to know it...
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Where's Turley?
South of here, past Chimayo.
They got a saloon there?
No hard feelings.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'm going to California with my brother.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Who?
What's that?
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
We didn't get that far.
He is now.
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
But the good citizens of Turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. I maintain the peace. So when strangers come to town, I always ask them their business. Have you come for the hanging?
What's stopping you?
Because they enjoy it.
Lucky.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
Luck, I guess.
Oh, yeah? How good?
Give me some of the good stuff.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Who?
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
-- It's called a projector.
Why not?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
What about it?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
You really think so?
Everyone you know is lying.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Do what?
I want you back too, Viktor.
Yes, call me Simone.
How about the nudity?
It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Absolutely not!
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I've seen them all before.
-- Flesh is weak.
-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I do.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Precisely.
You know me -- married to my work.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Lainey...
An insanity defence.
What?!
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
They are alive, Sayer.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
-- What you don't understand --
I was hoping you'd say that.
Thanks.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Yes, it did.
Yes, I am.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
You do?
Maybe.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
They?
...I don't know.
What are you talking about?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Which street corner?
...You any good with those?
No shit.
"And a slash-slash there --"
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Amends...?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Down boy.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
He's right. You were behind.
Chicken sandwich?
Yes!
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
I said that's enough!
Listen to me --
Never.
Second verse!
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
All the rib eyes?
I loved you. I loved --
Gold--digger, huh?
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Uh-oh.
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Well, thanks for the lift.
See ya, Kate.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
Also boring.
Bandit?
Why are we doing this?
This is Bandit I, come back.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
What else?  Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
That's the point, Dickey.
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
And a very bad gamble.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Two of 'em?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
...About what?
I'm not doing cocaine.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
I got his machine.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
...So you made another deal?
I don't see it like that at all.
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Yeah... Sid?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
No?  Who am I, then?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
How quickly?
Yes.
What?
Where's Sartorius?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Who was it?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
What is it?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Human beings can die.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
To calm my anxiety.
Yes.
I want you inside me right now.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
You didn't look very happy.
Rheya.  Not here.
Let's go home.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
I can't stay here.
I want you here.
Who are you, then?
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Hello, Win.
I got money.
Listen, that was my fault.
He said he'd kill me.
No dog.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Oh that thing in Queens.
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
I'll think about Wednesday.
So.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Claire...
Sure we are, let's go!
I don't know Tommy.
Get in bed.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
She's got to identify him.
I had to follow her to a store.
Did you hear what I said?!!
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
What did you watch?
I just sat and listened.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
What about when she identifies him?!
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Yes.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I brought the girl.  She's outside.
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
Mom and I got plans.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Shooting?
Take care, pal.
Cause if you get in a bind--
I'm always here, Pete.
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hm.  What a lump.
They'll never take me alive.
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Yeah--
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
What's this? A cockaroach?
What?
Does it have a human name?
I know what you mean.  I...
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
You sure about all this?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Precise equipment… such as waldos…
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
I'm not so happy myself.
Jawohl.
Jawohl!
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
How come the Krauts knew about that stove, Security? And the tunnel? How come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Tipping me off? I do not understand.
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
Not you.
What some brandy?
Abfuehren!
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
Say, Schulz --
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Stop it, Harry!
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
You're teasing me again!
It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
It's that song, Harry!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
You have a Lieutenant here...
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Good.
Any objections, men?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Anybody cover?
You off your rocker?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
We have no radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Russian women prisoners?
HoS qorDu. 
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
What do you mean?
I believe so.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
The station complement was nineteen.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
I don't understand.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
Where are the deflector relays?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Aye, sir.
Execute!
Nothing. As before.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
My readings indicate great instability.
Spock's burial robe.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I don't understand.
I'll go...
You said there wouldn't be any.
"... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book, Saavik.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
I think it's an energy form, sir...
Come on!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.

No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!

Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
... Or the one.
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
Understood, my lord.

I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
Thank you.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
But we can't just sit here -- !
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
He's on a build up to detonation!
Raise them --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Inoperative.
We'll be going to warp speed --
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Aye, sir.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
The word is given: warp speed.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
I would not presume to debate you.
Or the one.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
A distinct possibility.
Steady as you go...
Uhura, patch me in --
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
Engine room! What's happening?!
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
I'll try, Captain.
Aye, sir.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
Gillian --
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
Name?
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Stabilize Energy Reserve!... Report helm:
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
How soon?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
All right. The truth?
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
You need me.
What are the variables...?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Well done, Mr. Spock.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Yes?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
The tank will be finished by morning...
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
They did, Admiral.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
On speakers.
Everyone remember where we parked.
Uhura, you did what was necessary.  Keep trying. You'll find him...
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Millions?
Tell her I feel fine...
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Why?
There are days.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
I aspire to be more than I am.
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
Data doesn't breathe.
You're aboard the Enterprise.
I don't know.
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
The Ba'ku.
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Fail-safe?
Eject the core.
The purpose being...?
If it works you mean.
Eject the core.
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
Deck ten.
So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
We're not going anywhere.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
You should feel right at home with them.
But it's comfortable.
All ship functions are off-line.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
I do not know what you are referring to.
I... do not want this...
We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done.
How serious is the damage?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Always am.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
<U>Engage.</U>
California. San Francisco.
Something wrong with that?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Aye, sir.
On screen.
Life signs?
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
I think Mister Worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
No way.  You see this?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Come on...
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
How can I trust --
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Uhura, monitor!
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Quite right, Mr. Chekov. What is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain - and a degree of intrepidity. Before the Captain and Doctor McCoy freeze to death.
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Are you kidding?  Send to Starfleet Command...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
They'll be here...
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
You hear that?
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
The night is young. Anyway, it was logical.  You know, you're a great one for logic. I'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread. We're both extremists. Reality is probably somewhere in between us.
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
WE SURRENDER.
Who else?
Not as yet, sir.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
What?
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. Can I move now?
Indefinitely.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
I can see that.
Good work. The download?
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
Aye, sir... This way.
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Ready, Captain.
Of you?
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Do you have a name, sir?
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
Do you have life support?
What do we know about the population?
He wants to look me in the eye.
Deanna, on my mark.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
If you don't mind.
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Your new chair, sir.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
And the Senate supports you?
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Yes.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
There is that.
I was lonely...
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Why are you here?
You know that's not possible.
I see more than what you are.
It is... invigorating.
Now go. I have some personal business.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
I make maps.
About five miles back.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
When can we expect containment?
Clarify that.
I just retired.
Which way do you want to go?
Gear shift.
Eh... police.
Smile.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Yes. Very good.
Closed?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
From?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
You. Mouth closed.
I want to try it.
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Yes. Day... night.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
You want this ticket?
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Yes?
I was afraid.
I don't know.
You liked my singing?
No. Get in.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
I feel better if I move.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I'd like to...
You want the baby to laugh at me.
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Slow down, slow down.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Can you see under the faceplate?
No.
Wait'll you see it.
The police think he was high on drugs...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
Bullshit politics.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Fuck you.
Jesus.
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
That's a good one, coming from you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
No.  Mace is in this.
You think Tran killed her?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
That's right.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
What stuff?
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
I know.  So, I'm working for this puke, right?  And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
Sorry.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
No idea.
Black.  Jack.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Something in your car...
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
To break the trail.  If those cops had gotten hold of her, they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for, and then gone after them too.  Our killer is running as scared as we are.  Which makes him really dangerous.  Judging by how scared I am.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Testa?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Yeah.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Anybody talk to the press?
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Not bad, huh?
What do you want from me?
Yes.
What kind?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Smarter than us.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
What are you doing?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
You refused to comply with a direct order.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
How long ago?
I was visiting an old college friend.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Don't even go there. What's up?
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
What did you tell him?
That's true.
What's that?
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Suspect Zero?
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Maybe you should back off.
If I owe, I will go.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Murman!
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
How?
...And she's with someone else.
Who's your booking agent?
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
I heard you might be moving back...
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
What do you want? You're tall.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
What's dumb about it?
Sure.
No, man, we're in the play-offs.
Rejected?
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
You're crazy.
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Vegas.
Whu?
She smiled, baby.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Yes!
Sorry about interrupting...
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
How?
I just need some time...
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
Yeah.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
Tomorrow?
What an asshole. Didn't you see "Boys in the Hood"? Now one of us is gonna get shot.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
True.
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Yeah. You're just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
You're money.
Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
...Shut up, Sue...
I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
Maybe less...
If you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, I congratulate you Don Corleone.
Sure.
On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Accept what's happened, Michael.
How did you find out?
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
How?
Godfather, you understand everything.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Where are you going?
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Okay.  One minute.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
And when they shot me father...
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
I'm German-Irish.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
I'm thinking about it.
He'll be OK.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Is it true?
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Theresa.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Cut it out.
Probably a year...
I do renounce them.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
What are you doing in Mongi?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You just woke up!
Well, we ate everything without you.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Yes please!
Okay.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Sure.
Your parents met her.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
Ripley's plans.
Why?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Sure.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Ha. Did he say why?
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
That's a terrific idea.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Beating you away.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
I've thought about you.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
A ragione. A ragione. 
And tomorrow?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
You try. You try talking to her.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Peter, I... I...
What about Thomas Ripley?
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Who mam?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
What?
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
Well... mostly...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Sure.
Oh, Tom, please.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
What taxi driver?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Is he Italian?
You sure he's not Italian?
No, I'm serious, really...
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
The kind with a brush.
What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
A girl needs protection.
What's your real name?
Can I see you again?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I can't sleep nights.
Age?
Why?
Things got ya down?
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
I'm a field agent.
The cell, Mason.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
I am, too.
Whatever happens.
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Damn...
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
Well... where can we go?
I'm  fine.  Really.  
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Oh.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
My what?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
I do.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
You bet.
Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
They're...
Did you... did you...
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
I guess I did.
Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Thirty a month.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Of course.
Oh.
Thanks.
Oh.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
No, not really.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
I did.
Yes.
Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
Well, I suppose...
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Is she all right?
Lois!
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
It's a surprise, you see.
Of course.
Yep?
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
We'll make our own fog.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Lovebirds, I see.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Please.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Well...  Well... these birds attacked us.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Monday?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
But how... how do you know my name?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Yes?
Yes.
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Right next to the one you already had.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
What do you want ?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
Yes.
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
After the gulls attacked.
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
How about you?
Well, all right, but...
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
To...  To kill them.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
That would hardly be possible.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Good.
I'm only a student.
Of course I will.
It is a pity.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
I've heard of it.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
Well? And are you not a good student?
Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
I remember her.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
I can't believe that.
Pulse?
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
Not yet.
Don't call me that confounded name.
You will not have it?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
The same. Look here, Gray --
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
This is a gift.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
I would make you rich.
Beg -- beg of you! You crawling graveyard rat!
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Yeah?  I see doubt oozing out your arm. Where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
Tell her... we'll get him.
I think we should get some support?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
You killed that cop Dutton.
Have to find him first.
My father.
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
You mean Alex.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
No.
That was my first question.
Yes -- that is true.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
Yes.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Jittery is the word.
May I walk out with you?
Yes -- Just exactly.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I was.
But how -- how long--?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
This one could save your life.
What's Plan B?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
They're gonna book us.
Two down and two to go.
Star?...
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
The dun goes down and they'll be comin' for us.
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
Did we have a date tonight?
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I'll pass.
Smells like something died.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Must be a circuit breaker.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
No, I'm not...
-- a job.
Hi, Thorn.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
What about Mom?
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
You buy any of this, Blair?
How the fuck do I know?!
We ain't buying that.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Nothing we can do about that.
Well, get to it.
After all this mess then.
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Yes... Thank you.
This way.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
And why not?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You know I can't.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I care more about my life.  And yours.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Good night, Alex.
Sir...?
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Or mud carriers.
Learning was important?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
What are your people called?
He said he traveled for two months.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
Then it's time to change that --
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
What about Starks?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
That's too bad.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
They should just be looking harder.
Good.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Our car won't start.
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Then why isn't there anyone around?
William, you're not making sense.
To the hospital.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
I don't understand.
No. I don't want it to.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
Maybe.
Why not?
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Who told you this?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Great, get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Have you always been a waitress?
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
In the leg.
You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You girls are in some hot water.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
What's wrong?
Stop.
Shut up.
I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
What?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
I always knew that.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Oh yeah.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
So what if he was?  It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
West.  Left.
Which part?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Louise.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yeah.
Now what what?
Whaddo we do?
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Hit it.
Yes.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it.  I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for.  I mean Jimmy and everything.
Eeuww.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
What?
We've gone insane.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
All this for us?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Yeah feels like it.
I don't know what to say.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
No.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Big time.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Am I?
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
No thanks.
No, I mean
-- He's in a cage?!
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
How about -- ?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
No, forget it, it was stupid.
Sure.
Who the hell's Woogie?
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
So she hasn't changed?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
Nice.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Where would I have seen your work?
Huh?
Oh... are you... ?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
On your ear, you've got something.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
It.
What do you mean?
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Then they should speak up.
Yes it is.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
I want an hour with him.
Forget it, Scotty.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Yeah, a good political solution.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Don't get too attached.
Rug samples.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
You crashed my file?
Check him out, Ray.
Who the fuck is he?
Beats the hell outta me.
That's right.
Alright. Alright.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Why?
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
After we've completed our investigation.
Bullshit.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Let's go.
He knows me?
He said he doesn't know.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Cuz you're a cop.
Not no more.
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What?
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
If you ever need a place to come back to and listen to the trees a little... we'll be here.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Ray. What's your 20?
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
How the hell do you know?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
That's all!
Two meters.
And far too aggressive.
Lieutenant...
How about what?
You're an animal.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Just good luck.
What do you want?
Off me or off you?
Your watch.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
What is he doing?
This is crazy!
What is?
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
I can recover. Hold on!
Okay.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
What do you want?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
I've had enough...for now.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
What now?
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured out what?
Need a hint?
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
Some guys never get it back.
Didn't everybody?
How's it goin', Coog?
Yes sir!
I lost.
I'm nothing like him.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
What is it?
You better get down here.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Let me buy you a drink.
Move to Mars.
Just think about it.
Bye.
The hell you're not.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Beats me.  I just work here.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
What's he talking about?
Blondes.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
I gave you?
No problem.
You can't fight'em that way...
My cannon.
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
In a minute.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Could we make it to the mountains?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
You got that right.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
The rifle.
Oh shit!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Right.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
Yeah, Val.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Around here?  Why would they?
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
And one good guy.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
I noticed.
Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
Not necessarily...
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
-- The Nazi he knifed?
"Have to"? No...
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
You're doing a murder case?
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Screw you too, Kitty.
That's right.
Afraid of what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
You tell me, man.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
That's right.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
That's big of you, Bob.
Badgering.
-- alleged crime --
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
For control of the prison drug trade?
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
I want you.
NO! GOD, NO...
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Get lost Bobby.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Don't get funny with me again.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Thank you, Carl.
Well, where are you going?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
No.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
What do you mean?
It must be a high priority situation.
I don't know, Sam.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
We do notice things, don't we, Agent Desmond? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose?
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
When?
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
No, I want to smoke.
Donna, you are a muffin.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Dancing.
No.
Fill 'er up.
The pages are gone. That's real.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
I am The Muffin.
What? She asked about my father?
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Hiking?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
A friend from school.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
I always thought you knew it was me.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
That's right.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
You're right. There's no one here.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Abrams...
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
And no one will know the truth.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
It looks that way.
You would not...?
Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's right.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
And you wrote that...
Four. You're great with these kids.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
It's over!
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I can't guarantee that...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
And ask me what?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Yes.
Right.
I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What difference can that make...? All right...
The broad has disappeared...
She told me.
She did?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Me, too.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
But I think I know where she'll be....
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
How would I know...!
He's very excited about it.
And I...I've got other things happening.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
You didn't jump in.
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time.
Robert?  I...
He knows.
You sound so sure.
I can take it.
We were idealists.
I didn't know sir.
No, I can't.
I know.
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
Why then.
Like this!
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Passport?
Forget it.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  You'll be out of it.  You'll wake up.
Unfurl the squares!
It was my fault.  I slipped.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
They have every right Chuck.
I don't know.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
And being sixteen.
We'll think of something.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
Trust me donut.  I know.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Long enough.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Sir.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
Y'all take American Express?
We don't have no paper bags.
How old are you?
Well... Yeah - okay.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
What's that?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
No shit?!?! You know him?
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
What?
Didn't he say somethin'?
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
What's that?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
It's a comfortin' idea.
Trust me on it.
One bad car accident...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
What?
How can you say that, Sailor?
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Really, mama, I gotta go.
That's not why I called.
Yes.
Get rid of him?
Just tell me what you want.
Yes.
Yes.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Someone's gonna see us.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Where we goin'?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
So?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh...
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
I just mean...
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Yes.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Kidnapped? By who?
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Only in your bones?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
The Chancellor's here? Now?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
...we find the jacket.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
That was MacCaulay.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been having them?
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
You're in Kinship?
With Emily?
How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
It's very convincing.
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
Right.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
What are we going to do with...
Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Yes.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Amazing.
Kinship.
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
In a minute. Get us a table.
Okay.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I thank you.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
She's left before...
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
I heard.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
What's he doing out there?
Over there. In the backseat of the...
Grady.
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
I said it didn't sound like you.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
I know.
Dozens. It's very sad.
It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby.
He's still barking at me. He's blind.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
It's three-thirty, Grady.
Taking the long way home.
And?
Maybe I should read it.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
How is she?
Is it because of Anna?
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
You need a table.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
Annette will see you.
When?
It's not what you think.
Sure.
It's just a city park.
How does it sound?
That was terrific.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Not yet.
Cop.
I have no idea.
Why don't you just tell me?
Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
But you are taking it?
Yeah.
Lovers' quarrel?
No you're not.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
Yes you can, Robin.
Your daddy will always love you.
I said the job is okay.
It was just an idea.
By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
I don't feel anything.
She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
You couldn't say.
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
What?
In my bed too.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
What picture?
I'm just quiet.
Doesn't it get noisy?
You must hate it.
Yeah, they could.
Not tonight.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
Their power. They seduce me.
Nothing. It's over.
What?
Why not tell me now?
All three -- in chronological order.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
What happened?
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
But what did he see that made him panic?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
They'll come out after us.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
Who then?
We're here now.  Let's get her done.
Missed what?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
He's hallucinating badly.
She'll wait.
What! After giving us such a run around...
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
There's no comparison.
Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Okay. In a few minutes.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I don't love you.
I deserve it.
It couldn't be any clearer.
Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
Yes, yes, of course.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
And what did they say about me?
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
And do you remember where she got off?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
You really must do me this one favor.
Who?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
He loves you the way you are.
It's a sin to be fat.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Yes Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
I don't know... I don't know...
Love.
Everyone.
How were you sick?
Did it hurt?
And what happened?
I got sicker.
No.
How did she know that?
I don't know.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No.
Why not?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
I'm always bad.
She's dead isn't she?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
Alright.
No I'm not.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
What kind of trouble?  What kind of trouble Agnes?
Did you know what was going to come out?
It grew.
I'm afraid.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
You don't like brussel sprouts?
I hate them.
Do you know who put it there?
No.
What do you feel?
Do you remember what just happened?
Not your fault...
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
You got to be crazy.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Next week.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Yes.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
Two packs a day.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
How did she hide it during the day?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
The Catholic Church...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
There's another choice.
How?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
What is it?
Your niece!
Don't deny it!
The woman's health is at stake.
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Do you think they ever existed?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Listen to her singing.
Would it stop you if I did?
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
How  ?
Don't be ridiculous.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You're saying God did it?
Somebody told her.
Is it because she's a nun?
For what?  An abortion?
The baby?
And the baby.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Have I said something amiss?
We do.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Is he?
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Are you pulling my leg?
Oh aye, a sledge.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
What are you?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Of course.
Parading?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
You see, sly villains.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
What little old man?
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Can't he? He's done it, son!
Y'what?
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Hi, our lot!
Tonight? We can't make it ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh you are, I know you are.
Well ...
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ... 
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Is that you, Roby?
Cattle ranch!
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
Don't you remember?
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
A transmission?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Dead.
Right.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Yeah... well, maybe he should have.  I mean, you brought the goddamn thing in here.  Maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
How do we locate the creature?
At least it can't get up here now.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
I've completely lost their signal.
Oh... God...
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
Let's let the machine work on him.
Come on -- let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear.
Close...
Could be some kind of venom, or poison...
They never made it off the planet. The parasites won.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
But why draw it on the wall?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
We're coming!
By eating our food supplies.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
No, it's still breathing.  Kinda clammy though.  Are you sure your stick's not broken.
We're what!?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
You win some, you loose some.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Deal.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
Forget it, man.
What's wrong?
Auto-shop?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
What is that?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
What can I do?
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
It needn't be.
You take charge.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Aren't you?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
We're?
You have no right to say such things!
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
What do you mean by that?
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Yes, Addison.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
You were there? At the play - last night?
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
I take it she read well.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
That's nice.
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
As of this moment you're six years old...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
I had no idea you were even here.
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
The audition.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I must have frightened her away.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
I've been aware of that for some time.
Margo, let's make peace.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
Hear, hear...
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Why what?
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Is that what you want me to be?
You hear all kinds of things.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Buy some.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Why not?
Late for what?
You were just looking around...
I don't care if I never get home.
He's the best.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
Try...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
I won't forget.
He can help you.
Something most important you can do.
Over my dead body...
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
I had no idea you knew each other.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Peace and quit is for libraries.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
Not much.
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
What is he talking about?
Up in the room.
I will.
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Don't be evasive.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Just one person. Isn't that so?  You know what this is all about, don't you? It has very little to do with whether you should play "Cora" - it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with Bill.
What do you mean?
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
That's right, but I don't understand-
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
I promise.
Fuck you, Carl.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Why didn't we get that?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Who'd you vote for?
Go on, go on--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--has he got an ax?--
Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
How high up, which Republicans?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
Who?
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
This?  Naw...
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
You can't.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
I know where Dwight works.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
--there's nothing new in it--
--it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story--  --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
Five hundred; six maybe.
Give me your checkbook then.
There's always a later plane.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
I'm not your source on that.
Go on.
You asking me to disclose my source?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Go on.
Ratfucking.
Haldeman too?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Government. Recently retired.
It may never come out.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
I think we got a White House consultant linked to the bugging.
--maybe I'm tense--
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five. 
A girl. Melissa.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Thanks coach.
Sure.
I'm not good in math.
Pardon me?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Single malt?
Uh-huh.
Just go!
You're gonna shit your pants!
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Of course, I didn't --
What's your middle name?
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Because I want to.
How did you know I was here?
I know, it sucks!
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
You think she was serious?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
But --
That's stupid.
Yeah.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
I suppose that would be okay.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Ready for what?
What?!  How do I do that?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
That junior chick?
Keep it down, dude.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Thanks.
Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand... that's it...
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Like an underground club?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Fuck me...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
Really.
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
You on drugs? Huh?
No... I...
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Not that I know.
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
He says -
I'm not sure but look. . .
What happened to your parents?
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
I was all out of dynamite!
You are the Princess.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
I'll never let go!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
And this is my future. This is who I am!
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Pray he's color-blind...
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Please, if you'd just listen...
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Young	man, I...
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
What?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Why not?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Hey, that was last year.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh - you're an actress.
No, Chippewa Falls.
I'll getcha a piece.
Nice car.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
You want your gear? Here you go.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Fifteen years, yeah.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
what I mean?
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Okay?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Yeah.
You followed me!
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
and I keep, you know, it's-
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
I'm following you and David, if you-
No.
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Is he in the bathroom?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Holy cow!
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
I'm cool.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This is the first book that I got you.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
Oh!
Can I confess something?
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Don't get upset!
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
I mean that as a compliment.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Mean?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You'll total the whole car.
How about a ginger ale?
M'hm.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah. Right.
They're persecuted enough!
Yes, I do.
Well, hi!
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And here, you just-
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
You're fucking desperate.
She's got great tits.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Not this time.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Just don't fucking tell her.
It's not going to come up.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
He's not going tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Anymore.
No, not anymore.  Happy anniversary, scout.
Oh, very jealous.
Lucy overdosed.
Forget it, Judy.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
We've only been over this how many times?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
I'm ready.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't push me away.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Me too.
Me too.
I know.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Yes I did.
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Ours.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Oh don't.  Everyone says that.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
A lot of cakes.
Sorry?
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
I so wish I'd known.
I'm so sorry.
I...
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
No, no thanks.
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I wasn't finished.
Okay.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
What does that mean?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
No.  Not something new.
You're my best friend.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
The both of you.
Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Not nice.  Not kind.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Divinely?
Quiet -- sshhh!!
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Worker!  Come back here now!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Yes...he's wonderful...
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Duty calls!
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
...Not enough food?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Something the matter?
Sheldrake?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Would you like to?
No. Like a man.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
Eight-thirty!
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
Cheers.
Three.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
You don't have to entertain me.
Gin.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Gin.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I would.
For me?
Gas.  Didn't you turn it on?
In this house, you're supposed to.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Might as well go all the way.
Cheers.
I mean, after that?
I'm fine.
Shut up and deal!
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
You better.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
You know how people talk.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Mine?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
Naturally.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
How's that again?
Now hold on, Baxter --
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Yes, sir.  They are indeed. 
Oh, I'm very grateful.
What do you want?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Me?
Something like that.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
Family?
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
And what happened to you?
No.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Why did you take sleeping pills?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
I love you -- remember?
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Stop that, Fran.
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Dreadful.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Sit down -- we'll talk about it.
Sure, thanks.
Sort of.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Who are you ?
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
Yes, sir --
Shot himself. What for ?
When'd you do it?
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't give him no medals or nothing --
Maybe.
Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
Charlie?
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Your daughter.
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
When did you hear?
I met him.
What about this point here?
Yes, I know.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You can't have water after morphine.
How's yours?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'm taking you back.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
That's me.
What is this bridge?
Why didn't he shoot you?
What things?
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
Oh.
How did she..?
I don't want to talk any more.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
New to the country, kid?
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
That's right.  You're not.
You know Meyerling?
You don't get it, do you?
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Stay out of it.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Huh?
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Spencer.
Carol the waitress?
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
What are you doing here?
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
How to die, mostly.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Okay by me.
Well, I can't reach them.
What?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
What are you talking about?
I love you.
But you know where you're lucky?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Um, five.
Ten million --
Why?
Right.
Because I'm done.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
It's not the same, is it?
More or less.
How old were you?
Are they usually like that?
They become complicated... messy.
That's fiction.
Good.
Thinking.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Sorry.
Cheap as shit.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
What did he want?
Ten years later, here you are again.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Nobody ever sees me.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?  I don't know.
Both.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
I hope not.
Average.
Can I ask you a question?
You mean quit?
How would you like the funds?
Of course, senor.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Care to elaborate?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
That makes you an expert I guess.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
So?
Tough break.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I've been saying that since we met.
Can you do the lock on it?
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Why don't we go together?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
Both, see you later.
No, We aren't going to do it.
Damn!
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Yeah, somewhere?
Do you want me to see what's on them?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
But we could go to London and live in England.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
It's not so much.
Okay.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yo, dobree!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Deal!
What for?
Well she sure isn't normal.
Not all of them!
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Yeah.
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
You are quite sure it's secure?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
I. Don't. Dance.
It could help with a new car --
-- I like the car I have.
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
You're fine like that, Mom.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon --
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
I don't want to have any conversation.
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
That is my telescope.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
You're hardly nice to anyone.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
It means you can do anything.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
That. And less strange.
Where?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Anything you want.
Nothing.
I don't want to come here anymore.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
But if you could, you would?
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
I thought she built it herself.
When do I get time for me?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
You came here to give me my report card?
You're welcome.
What do you want, Biff?
Fine.
Uh, thanks...
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Yeah. Maybe so.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
You do?
Coming, Eileen...
What drill?
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
Well... yeah...
Lemme see that.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
And where am I gonna be?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
What?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Pro, the sun's out!
Then where the hell is he?
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
Just a guess. I figured kids would still be drinking Coke in 1982.
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
Well, it was there.
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
No, he showed me one.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
Yeah. I can imagine.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
What for?
Quit my job.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
Put that down. It's dirty.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yes.
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Fine.
Hold it right there.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
He offered you money?
Everybody okay up here?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
She was killed, Penny.
You don't wanna know.
Go where?  Where're you going?
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think.
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
I have a radio fix...
John Whorfin will kill us!
Should we be on Code Red?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
...I know this must look... funny.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
...Who is this?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I'll bet. Jesus – "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
And what would that be, son?
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
Well what do I tell him?
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
Where there's life there's hope.
You're leaving?
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
He's a little funny in the head.
...Fred...
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
Thank you.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Who?
She said what you said she'd say.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
I don't smoke.
I quit.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Why not?
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Ice?
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Everybody that I care about dies.
Why?
Funny.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
No thank you.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Did you ever tie him up?
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
Why would I need an attorney?
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
What kind of talk?
I hope I helped you out.
You did.
Hallelujah.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
She's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
Yeah.  I know.
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
We bring her in for questioning.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
What about me?
On what basis?
Not sure. How was yours?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Of what?
New York.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Aren't they?
You want a drink?
Hi Dad. Hi Nora.
Cut it out, man! And don't be callin' me that shit!
I can get ten.
I'm here.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
You mean like an ape?
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Who's John Henry?
You don't have any fucking money..
I'm your family.
Well thanks!
You mean babies with you?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
It's three thousand dollars!
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
What time is it?
5:11.
I can't. After the show.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
I didn't know.
I need this?
I will relay the message.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
Things change.
Nor I, on the second.
'S'okay, I had to go home, feed my cat.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
One way to find out?
... eight, seven...
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
I don't.  So, no.
Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Women.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I recognized the accent.
You'd be surprised.
What exactly are you doing?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
How about, nice to see you?  Glad you're here to save my life.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Can he save her?
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
From the other side of the equator-
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
And she did it all for me.  For love.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
I find that unlikely.
How about dangerous curves?
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
It'll never work.
She has an excellent mind.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
What?
My life's an open book. You read?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Nostrovia.
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
...Not the bat?
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Fred?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Don't bogart that 'trode.
About what?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
If not for you I never would've made it. You know that. My own parents couldn't have...  ... The boy, Alfred. You'll both be provided for. Don't let all this got to waste.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Odd desire for anyone.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
Because I want someone I can trust.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Is that what you "heard"?
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
Yum, yum.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Great. How??
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
David, I'm serious!
Hi.....  Roses.
Meaning?
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?
Annie, it's me.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Great news.
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... Yes.  Great news.  Fabulous.  Triumphant.  Course it might need a little smoothing over.  When's he due?
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Ahm....
Sean Connery.
Great, good.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Nope.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Me first?
Huh huh. No way, dude.
My butt's bothering me!
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Heh hmm heh heh.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Heh heh. We wanna do her now!
Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes and chicks! We're gonna score!
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Bunghole...
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Who knows?
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Almost.
Adam!
How's your arm?
That's how long you were gone.
This is going to take some time.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
At least we won't have to worry about her.
<u>You</u> left me.
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
All right.
And this used to be your house, I bet.  Why do you want to scare everybody?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Really.  I don't know.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
No, wait!
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
They're dead.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
I want to get in.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Thank you.
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
That's good.
Hello, Eve.
Yes.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Yes, so do we.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
I like to watch.
Hello, Eve.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
I see.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
... I see.
Yes. I like that very much.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I understand.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
I like to watch.
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
No. I don't object.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I am a very serious gardener.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
Correct.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Try again.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
No headaches?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Very good, Your Excellency.
No problem, Chief.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Yes, I did.
... Well?
It's that serious, huh?
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Enjoy.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
What?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Now?
I have to go back now.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Yes.
Don't forget me.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I'm a puppeteer.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Forget it.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Yessir.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'm right?
The usual, Barry.
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Please, let me explain.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Sure. It'd be fun.
My God.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Hush, sweetheart.
Can I be anyone I want?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Think, Jew florist?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
No you mustn't, my child.
I love you, Lotte.
One hour.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Is there dancing?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Derek Mantini!
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
and she is mine...
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
No. Since mama lost her job, we don't have no more pies..
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes ma'am..
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
No..No that won't do...
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Won't you be late for work?
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Her who?
Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
Till she showed herself.
Ella.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You planning to do anything about it?
What yard? When who-
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Paul D.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Yes sir.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
Why me, man?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
But I guess she told Dieter.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Hey, man, I'm not--
ANTI-SEMITE!
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
That is for the urn.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Where's your car, Dude?
Uh-huh.
I've had a--
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Far out.
I see.
Heh-heh--
In the briefcase?
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
You mean coitus?
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
Take a look at this, sir.
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
The main guy, Dieter--
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Finder's fee?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Yeah, but--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
That's the simple part, Dude.  When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat  it out of him.
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
What the fuck?
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
The bulk of the series.
Uh.
Is the car out front yours?
And the fucking money!
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
It is a fucking emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
Yeah, and you were--
He can't walk, Walter!
Call the medics, Dude.
Okay, listen--
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
WHAT?!
Well. . . yeah.
A world of pain.
This is a league game, Smokey!
What about Nomak?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
I don't think so.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Took you long enough.
What do you really think?
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
He was here.  Watching us.
Yeah, but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
Any casualties?
Scud.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
Take him.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
I'm sorry, I --
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
He will.
How can you tell?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
What are you talking about?
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
We weren't sure we could trust you.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
Try, please, Anna--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Yes.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
--I'm not staying here!
--a six week bun in the oven--
Then there she blows.
What?
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You don't want it though.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Then I'm going--
Looks like a rope.
What? That made her lose the baby?
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Try a long walk.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
Don't have one.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
For "James?"
--Graduate Thesis--
All I need--
--it's less than four feet, just--
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Okay.
That's why she kills children.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Anna--
Why?
Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
--thank you for calling--
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
What?
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
I don't know. I better get off now.
Yeah.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
...Hell.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
You're an idiot.
That's not the point.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Okay.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Bull.
Yeah.
Jeffrey.
THEN WHAT?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
No. I should go.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
Kiss me.
No. it's not Don.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
Yes.
They hurt his head.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Here's to Ben.
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Where are they?
I don't know. you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I don't know. he moved away.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Two.
I'll drink to that.
You saw a lot in one night.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm really sorry.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Just some fatherly advice.
It's okay.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Dorothy Vallens?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
... Sandy?.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
I'll get a coat for her.
You can change it if you want to.
... Stop it Mike.
Um-hmm.
On the plane.
Motherfucker works fast.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Yes, I am.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
For calling you a homo.
That was out of line.
Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.
Murder.
What kind of project?
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Allo?
How are we doing?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
Coke.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Oh, I see.
Who's the cheapskate?
Un sapo?
It's beautiful.
Freedom.
Keep them coming.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I'll tell her.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
I like fire.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
California, huh?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
It's alright, Dad.
Shhhh.
They're over at the booth.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
No, man.  I'm too fucked up.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
Which "district" do you belong to?
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
So -- where do we start?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
Then how did it get into his body?
Yes.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
I had some papers to pick up.
No -- never.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Why do you think she left you?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
No.
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
That's all Dr. Paley.
No.
No.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What changed?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
A.M -- or P.M.?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
No pain, no gain?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Sure.  Where to?
Is it against the law?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Hi, Frank.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
Really?
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Why don't you talk to him now?
We have to talk.
Where have you been?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
It didn't get there from me.
No. You can have them.
What problem?
'82.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
That's it!
I bet mom could've helped her.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Not this kind of heat.
That's it.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
No.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Francesca. Robert.
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
Oh you!
Why, do you think?
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You get used to it.
What?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Yes.
But it's not the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Do you want to leave your husband?
I already apologized.
Yes! Hi.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Uh-huh. And?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Sure.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
You people really don't like dogs.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
What the hell you talking about?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Climb out to where?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Bones.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Time like this, is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Who?
Mother!  No.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Fuck it.  Alright.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
What building?
But --
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Just admit it, Caesar.
You don't need a key.
Give it to me.
There's no time.
That doesn't make any sense.
See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
Violet, I won't let you leave.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Where, then?
I don't know.  it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time.  Let's get out of here.
Shut up, Violet.
You betrayed me!
Good boy.
But everybody is all right.
Where's the fucking money?
What?  How about a drink?
Where is it?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
How do I know you are cops?
Good guess.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
My pleasure.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.
Basically.
Almost five years.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What was it then?
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this.
Yeah.
Does the case lock?
Yeah, twice.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
Why?
So it's time to go home.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Yes, I'm here...
You are a friend of his?
That'd be great.

<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?

Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Go ahead.
...omigod, no...
I didn't know this would happen.
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
It's a company... MPG Capital.
What is that?
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Yes.
Not really.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Get everyone down in the basement.
What's that?
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
... have a look.
...sabotage!
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
You must save the day.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
What?
You got the wrong man.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Where do I get it stamped?
Information Adjustments.
Ah.
Who are you?
Them?
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Suit me?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, all wars do -
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Turn around!
Get away!
Turn!
No you're not!
Oh my God, a mistake!
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Tuttle?
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
What's the matter?
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Who's that? 
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Pregnant.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
He looks like a cop.
She asked me to pick her up.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Yes.
No.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Don't seem so bad to me.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
No, no.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I quit! I'm through!
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
Yes.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Okay, whatta I do?
No shit.
Don't push it, Larry.
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Why?
That's your full name?
Why do you say that?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Okay, great -- good luck.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
I'm not kidding.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
Wipe me out?
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
Move away from me.
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Just a two-second dissolve.
How do I get out of here?
Yes.  That's right.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
I'll speak to you.
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
It's not opinion.
I was a lot earlier.
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Yes.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
It's not important.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Good night??!
How can you say that to me?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Through the closet.
I'm going home!
N-no...
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Carla...
Oh...
Of course I do!
That means you like me!
Would you let me make...a statue of you?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I wouldn't give up your day job.
Nothing...nothing at all.
I know, man.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Now what kind of statue was that?
What is it, your laundry?
Huh?
I didn't buy it I made it.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well I don't know -
Good night Walter.
Yeah, why?
Just wait till you see this!
Yeah?
Hm.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I ain't going no place with you!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
T-tell him that?
I had him in my grasp.
What's with you?
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
I'm fine.
Probably.  What movie is this?
Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
It's the news, Buffy.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
Is that your car?
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling.
You sure?
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
Dress, huh?  What for?
What for?
I'm glad you came.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Get away from me!
Well, where?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
To bring you... your birthright.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
What?
Okay.
I had to test you.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Oh.
Buffy...
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
All right.
But --
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute...
You want some punch?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
Run.
You said "Crash".
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
It's all the same thing.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Just till I lose.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
I think you're real cute.
He did?
You don't have to...
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
We all deserve to wear white.
What do you believe in?
G'night.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I want you desperately!
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
We gonna fuck or what?
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
But he ain't seen my heat--
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
He did know.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
Yep.
You're the boss.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
My right.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Pussy.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
We'll be praying for you.
Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?
Can I give you my testimony?
Ain't he warning up?
Eight and twenty-four!  How'd we ever win 8 games?
Where does he go?
Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
I can't believe you're doing this.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
This is a very auspicious occasion.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
The worst was Blue.
Lester...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
Why, somebody's complaining?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Yeah?
Yeah.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Please...
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nick?
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Ace, listen to me.
...position...
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Why not make them happy?
Right away. Okay?
Okay. 
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
Good luck.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Yeah.
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Okay.
It's chinchilla.
Oh, it's so soft.
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
All right...
Yeah.
And where'd you go?
I was with somebody.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
You fuckin' whore!
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Well...
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
God! 
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me.
Hey.
I understand.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
Uh-huh.
Artie! Artie!
What?
I know.
No problem.
I understand.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
And how are things going down there?
Yeah, no shit.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
I can see that. Sure.
Bye.
Nothin'.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
Let me think about that.
Exactly.  He hates me.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Okay, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
No, Lester.
Okay, then.
He was just on the phone.
I just talked to him.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
Of course.
You jag-off.
What's takin' so long over there?
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Angelo and Buster.
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Ch-Charlie M!
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
I don't know. I can't remember.
I wonder..
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
What do you want from me?
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I got her...
Absolutely.
You think so?...Selina?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
Ask me another one--
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Actually, yes.
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
You are...
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
You going to talk all day?
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
How was I in the wrong?
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
What about the others?
That makes two of us.
That's not her.
I'm trying to.
Not a chance.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Lucky for them they didn't.
Your husband?
Yes.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
At least one.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You could've hit me.
You wouldn't --
What's Nels' number?
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Why are we stopping?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Who is this?
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Pass.
Some loyalty.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
We don't see you.
You'll see her.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Government business?
From here on, I dish it out.
She's not a girl, Col --
Did he?
What would you call it?
Persistent.
Who the fuck is he?
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
She's not a tart.
She's not that either.
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
Who's she?
Perform?
I wonder.
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Jesus.
I am.
Dil --
Apologies, my sweet.
Never said a truer word.
Must be.
Nothing's wise.
That's a start.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
I'm working on it.
Please, Jimmy.
Not at all, honey.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
And you're not going to tell me more?
Do you like me even a little bit?
Afraid so.
No.
You promise?
You like me better like this.
It was you...
Don't you want to kill me?
It's my name, Dil --
Yes. Now.
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Please, Dil --
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Someone's got to do it.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I know that.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Can't.
Am I?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
What do you know about my nature?
No, what's the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
My inside pocket.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Ever see hurling?
Never.
These things take time, Fergus.
Why?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Oh, yeah.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Some kinds of women are...
What?
A story.
No.
You won't run.
Hurling --
You shut your face --
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
It's lovely.
Lord, you're stubborn.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Only we call them agents.
We? You mean you're --?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Carson?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Open it.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Then who does?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
You can't.
Whitefoot, of course.
Who told you to do that?
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Who?
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I'm very cold.
Did you?
And this? And this?
No -- in my room.
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Voilà what?
Quitter.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Come on. You can't stay here.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
I don't think I follow you.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
What was what?
Where?
What?
Do you tell lies?
The man you had the fight with.
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
I never fucked Rod.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
Ok!
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
What's wrong?
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
Not much further.
No honey.
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
St. Michael's.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
No.
I won't.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Stag?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
That's not why we broke up.
Sharon's far from a slut.
What?
I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
I need to ask you something.
That's what he said.
Who is she?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Two men left town right after it happened.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Are you Jody?
And she didn't?
They're tasty.
Hide your laptop here.
No.
I'm not leaving it here.
Art.
...Darlene pay you in cash?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
...and fair...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Huh?
Oh.
...-er.
Peace.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
All right, then how about this?
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Shut...
 Excuse me...
Do you wanna give me a minute?
Yeah, borrowed!
You stole this truck!
I ain't playin' that.
You're nuts, goin' back there!

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
 Yeah...
...let live.
 
Hey!  Hey!  Andy's Ice Cream.
Oh!
Back up!  Back...
...do we?

Oh, Petey.  Oh, Petey.  Oh, please, Pete.  Please don't do this to me.  Okay.
...easy, easy, easy.
Come on.
...Night Shift, but you might...
All right, you got it, you got it!
I made it!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
...ho!
Come on.
Okay.
All right.
All right, let's go.

Come on!
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
It won't even start half the time.

And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...

Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
 Whoo!
Even though it is nice to see Andy...

What?

Oh.
Yeah.
Okay. 



We've got Elvis!
He's comin' up fast!
What the--?
 It says forty- nine.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Always the negative...
I think so too.
...-tiatin'.
Yeah.
Be cool.  Be--
...about him.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Three seconds.  One...
So...where's my truck?
We do need your truck.

A ruler?
The print's pretty fine. I forgot my glasses. I'd like to be able to read across.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
Probably.
Honest?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
His girlfriend?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Yes... I think I can manage...
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
Of course I do. Where are you?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
How about a glass of wine? Honey, this is...
I'm not.
Thank you...
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Who?
No.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
What for?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
I'll stop by.
Well, how much would you like?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
That your maiden name?
So you married your father's business partner?
Oh, yeah?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Working for the District Attorney.
The Albacore Club.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
She's my daughter.
Back to Mexico.
I have to go home and get my things.
He didn't wear bifocals.
I'm all right.
I think I got something.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
When did you come in?
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I don't understand.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
What about the water?
Sure you do.
Mr. Gittes...
Then go home and forget about it.
Yeah.
Yes. No.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
They were partners.
What about?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
But...who...
For what?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Somebody stole it.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
Look at that.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Charlie?!
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
I don't my plans myself.
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
Has he said when he'll finish?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
Emily!
Emily, you -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
What's the matter with you?
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
In the water.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
Thanks.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I didn't say.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
I mean in New York.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Yes, sir.
All right.
Yes, sir. 
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
I'll get you some coffee.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
How do you do, Charles?
I know, but -
Yes, sir.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
What did you get?
What do you mean?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
What is this, a poll?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Yeah, but not in here.
Dick.
It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
And you said yes?
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
I just told you.
You don't have anything to do with it.
But can we date?
You mean, on a date?
Pack of cigarettes.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
I wanted to use your car.
She called you Brad?
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
You know what I just watched?
Empire.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
I think they were Catholics.
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
I guess not.
The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
All of them.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
What!?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
Who found him?
Listen to you.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're happy to get a fine?
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
What responsibility?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Lovely story.
Thanks.
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
You need a ride?
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
One seventy-nine.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Oh... Can I help you?
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
What were you doing up so late?
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
How flattering.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
All right. Name it.
He requested this?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
I feel sick.
What did he say?
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
I don't want to go back with her...
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
I think it's coming now...
Can I have your name please?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
He's your cousin?
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
All right, asshole, you're on.
I will. Take it easy.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
So, what do you see?
The money!
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
What if he can't?
Where's Hal, what's going on?
Excuse me?
We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Now you get burned.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Sue me.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
There.  You blind?
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Do you always transport through the air?
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Let's move your ass in there!!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
Kill him when he gets down.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
Great, sir. Great.
Who are they, sir?
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Alex.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
Keeping fit then?
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
Let me get up.
Blue eyes?
Yes, sir.
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, sir!
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Yes?
I just say what the other person would say?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
I've done my best, have I not?
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Yeah... Pete the English.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
The ride is free.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
It's no big deal.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
There were two of us.  I had the other guy killed.  Don't need the competition...
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
In my office?
Where are you, what floor?
Did better'n that.
The crowd had to dig it.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
I said.  Get the gun.  Out.  Of my fucking <u>face.</u> Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
No harm done, ma'am.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Of course!
I brought you flowers.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Oh.  Sorry.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
It's not that kind of job.
The trunk?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
What'd he do to you?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
Yeah.
I'm not catching a melody.
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
Leave me alone.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Jazz.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Makes two of us.
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
...indifferent.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
Geronimo?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I can't promise you anything.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Yeah.  I think so.
Believe you about what?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
You got a list?
Never heard of him.
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Where then?
They're big details, Jerry.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Where are we going, Jerry?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Did you kill him?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Well, I don't know if --
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
I don't believe you.
You sound so sure.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
You're --
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
I don't understand.
For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
Put it on speakers.
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
This is how you see the sky?
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
Is that your official response?
Could we hear God?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
You too.
Make that two.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
Hi.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Git movin', I said.
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I don't know, Boss.
You don't know!
I... I... I...
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Well, whatta we got here?
You tryin' to say somethin'?
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
You just said he could eat anything.
You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Cuter again.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
He was lying.
When was that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Who was the man in the basement?
No.  Not yet.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Who?
Because of your phone calls.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
Work with me.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn self righteous.
Let me get a little action started here.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
I'll get a locksmith.
Go and look for a note.
What else?
Just get out of your vehicle...
Over here.
Who prescribes the brandy?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
Michael Johnson.
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Who came in after you?
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
I like women like that!
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
I said you were...
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
How about I put Nikko on it?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
I know.  Get out here.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Because I think I'm wrong.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Thank you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
You should have gone to the funeral.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
You're not envious?
Do you find him attractive?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Isn't that rather too close...?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
And the party?
You look beautiful.
You're slowing.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
That's thanks to all your help.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Mom, please.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
I guess so. I think that's right.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
It's magic.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
So, it's over?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Yeah?
Steak?
I think I should go home.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
And all the plans we have.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
What do you want to do?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
No, it's not like that.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
No...
It doesn't matter who.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Sure, I understand.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
They don't have a murder weapon?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
Oui.
You're calling me on is phone?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
We'll think of something.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
Good idea.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
No?
You haven't answered my question.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Man, I can get anything.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What room number?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
What the hell is he talking about?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
No.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
They sort of got away.
Yeah.   It's mine.
You see that car?
No shit?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
Take a nap.
Sounds boring.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
He is my defeated foe!
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Where is he now?
Jen!
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Let them look.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Well, we had talked...
She needs direction... and training.
Shu Lien...
Save your strength.
But don't be too lenient.
We must avenge mother!
But the sword could be in his compound.
Don't thank me.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
It's only a flesh wound.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
You're not gonna come back, are you?
I went to see a friend of mine.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
T-Bird?
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
On my mother's life.
Great book.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Give it up.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's also none of your business.
Yes.
Of Human Bondage.
I will.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
I have feelings for you.
Yes.
Doesn't ring a bell.
- none taken -
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
That's great.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
I am?
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
You think he'll like it?
I swear.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Some other time, Cecile.
I do.
No. This is going to be our last session.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Who told you?
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
What?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
Shhh.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
So what went wrong?
No, tell me.
And that's why you're leaving?
And I don't.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Is that what you think?
Annette?
Will you calm down?
Didn't you hear what I said?
Get out!
I think you have your answer.
War it is.
What about her?
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
She's not here.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Excuse me?
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
I'd love to.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
But quite harmless, I'm sure.
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Oh, lots of times.
Sometimes.
But where did you get it, Amy?
I got my wish anyway.
What's her name?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I'm never unfair.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
But I told her to go with you.
And you should.  Your mommy tells me you've been such a good girl, and your daddy is so pleased with you.
Did you mail then?
Voices from an old dark house!
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
But there's no one here, darling.
I'm your friend.
I shall want you for always.
Your children?
I shall wear it in my hair!
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
A lady threw it to me.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
It got hit.
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Never felt better.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
George bit you?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
And my bra finally fits again.
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
I think he called you beautiful.
No they're not.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
I haven't gotten it yet.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye.
Did you get rid of Mark?
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
You should have seen it erect.
Peter keeps asking me out.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
So what do I do?
I wish I only had your problems.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
Sure. See ya.
Starving.
You don't have to pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Script coverage?
So what book did you buy?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
No, she died when I was twelve.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Yeah. Maybe.
What are they for?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. I was doing my laundry.
I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
A man killed in Central Park.
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
Tell her I'm eating.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
What makes her think that?
What kind of animal?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Sorry, sir.
Fine.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
That's what people keep telling me.
Yes.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
I'm...  being...  punished.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
The usual...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
For a month.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
I can't believe he'd do this.
I don't give a shit.
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Fine.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Check his kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Bob...
Don't do this.
I'll lock him away for good.
Dave -- I'm working.
They could put you in jail.
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
Why?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
I can't say.
Oh.
Home.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
Yes.
You find people jobs?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
That's okay.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Quiet!
MISS HENRIED, SHUT THE HELL UP!!!
Tonight?
We think there are other cities surviving. We think maybe Detroit... there's some signalling out of Philly.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Curse?
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Will do.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Knox?
Well?
So?
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Mr. Dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  Others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  Bend over and grab your shins.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
You know,
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
The pleasure is mine.
I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
But I love you.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Are you going with Chet?
Then come with me.
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
A madman.
Don't stop!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Yes sir.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
My brother went here.
I don't.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Yes.  But
So?
And now he will?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
I'll come to the performance.
Why don't you want a message sent?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
It ain't any better out there!
Who asked you to!
I'm not a thief.
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Takes one to know one.
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
How do you know that?
A meat locker.
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
And what if I run into one of those things?
Forget them...
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
Joey...look at me...
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
One whistle... Start the engine...
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Where is everybody?
A passenger...
What the hell does that mean?
She fucked me too.
Fuckin' A!
We're all going.
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Married?
Yeah.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Yeah.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Vince!!!
Psst. Vince!
Inside, Vince.
No?
Biederman!
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Naw, it's... I mean...
Nick. It's okay... It's okay.  I have to go now.
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Right.
Huh?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
Hell no!
Promise! You gotta promise!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
What are you, hoping?
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
What do you think?
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
I like it, Nick.
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
See you Monday.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
It's not socks, Sal.
Aw, it's a long story!
What's it for??
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
Never one.
Yeah.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Kimberly!
Your mother.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I'm not voting for you.
And I want Doucet.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
He could be brought back.
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
Fine.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
How do you know?
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Not yet.
You never want to find out.
But he was such a good cop.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
What's your name?
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Young man -- you got me there.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
That's just too bad --
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
We'll be mighty glad to have you with us.
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Yes, why shouldn't it?
I'm through with you.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Well, I --
I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Shake!
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Yep.
That's what we said.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
Looks right elegant, Mary.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone!
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Consarn the consarn --
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
I dunno.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
That is Christmas music.
It's corny, but I could live with it.
John.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
Holly Gennero?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Yeah.  So how are you?
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Shit...
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Yeah... yeah!
You try calling the police?
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
I'm afraid.
Who's this?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
They're okay.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Calm down, you're not ...
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
You and me are checking the other ways in and out.
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
I don't fool around with you.
Special to me, too.
We like you, too.
What now, Sonny?
Yeah.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
Let's go, Sonny.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
We won't have to.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Gimme the black guy...
You follow my car. 
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Maybe...
Did Pop come down?
Doing what?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Newsman, not ...
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
Maybe you should fuck her mom then.
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Be kind to your sitter.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Must you use that awful word?
I said stop it.
I can certainly think of one more!
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
There are no bond certificates.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
Not really.
Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
So?
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Two dollars!  Forget it!
You a troublemaker?
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
I've done that before.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
I'll see ya there.
I didn't stutter.  You heard me.
How are you holding up in this weather?
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Fuck!  My money!
Do I have to spell it out?
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Keep it.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Trust me.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, it's not like that.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Magic Johnson.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
I don't know.
HATE!
I know.
So what do you want me to do?
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Depends how you define 'new'...
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
You did?
Would you like something to drink?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
What? No! Look.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
What?
Me too!
The principal.
The second R is silent.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
Exactly! A pirate!
Kids.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
I kinda screwed things up.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
HARRY!
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Me, me, me!
What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
Sorry, no further questions.
No. Look.
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Oh, you're good.
That's not your tape.
Do you want me to pet your head?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Oh, go on.
That's it. I'm done.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Have you got what I want?
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Piter.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
Nothing.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Basically...
Sire!
That's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. See the spotters over it? They're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... Looks like a good patch of spice.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
I'm sorry Gurney.
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
As the legend says.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Excellent!
Where are we do you think?
No.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Thank you.
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Take my word for it.  You want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "Dracula."
I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Do you want me to get it for you?
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
You're shooting "Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85.
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Yeah, I did.
But maybe not.
Don't let me slow you down.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Don't you have any savings?
Soon, Bela... Soon.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Eddie, how was I?
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
This is kind of a stream--
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Oh!  You got nerve, buddy.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Like <u>what</u>?!
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Yeah.  Exactly!
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Yes?
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
It's the same film.  But the distributor wanted a punchier title. C'mon!  It's gonna be a big event -- we're going all out!  Bela, Tor, and Cris are coming.  You'll have fun!
Lines around the block.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Wow.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
What?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
I ... don't know. I ...
No. It's a mess.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Holy sh--
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
What's the matter?!
Oh God. What hospital?
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Ma...
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..."
You batted or you bunted?
Who's in it?
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Cream rinse?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Right.
Ha!
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Saturday, I think we should
I know, I ...
Ohh...
Twenty-nine.
Come on, let's go.
Okay.
Are you all right?
What do we have to do?
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
What?
You're in show business?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
What's the dif --
Yeah...
You brought the cameras here!
You brought the girl!
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Who's Shari?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Sure.
What is? Oh, dinner!
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
He likes it.
All right.  I'll be back
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Yes, I do.
Thanks, Mr. M.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
Hey, that's super
That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Would you sign it for me?
Oh.
Three twenty-five.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
What do you mean?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What's it to you?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Lynn.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
More.
I don't know.  I swear it!
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
I was thinking Detective Bureau.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
Why?
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Not good enough.
Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Some reality.
I know how he feels.
Right now, before I back down.
What's Dudley's scheme?
Is she?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
I like it!  I like it!
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
Oh Jesus.
Nothing.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Do it!
Clear as day.
I'll come straight there.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
What do they have to do with this?
That's who they are.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
It's a SAT-tracker.
They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
I called my wife!
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
None of your business.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
What's going on?
Where?
You're driving.
They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes.
Reynolds.
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
Well then who can?
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
I'm married.
That's fine.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Is that good?
What size?
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
Thanks.  Who are you?
The robbery.
Than why can't you tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Right.
You should take this seriously.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I've seen it.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I know.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Was that doctored-up, too?
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
Yeah.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Who?
Here, you can use this.
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Brill.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
You got a minute?
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
This conversation's over.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Otherwise you may have to what?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Seat 74.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Brill.
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
Fuck off.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
She can't talk to you right now.
Dad!
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
Usually they take clothes.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Into what?
They killed Rachel.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
Yeah?
Bobby--
It's been a few years.
The police?
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
Why not?
I said fuck you.
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
We found the originals.
Who?
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
You're kidding me.
We don't know.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
What kind of fossils?
That insults them.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I believe you still have my book.
That makes it harder still.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is empty, just coming!
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
Where've you been?
What if I told you he did this to me?
I liberated it.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Well, she is!
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
K is for Katharine.
Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
Kip's another one.
Hana, I know you do!
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church.
He can't even move.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I had a hotel room.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Yessir.
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
What's he saying?
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
Where are you at least?
I have a proposal for you.
I'll call an ambulance.
So alive.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Possibly.
Can you follow simple directions?
Look on the back. What do you see?
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
In a week.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
No. It's a down payment.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
The lipstick thermal camera?
It's---beautiful.
To our...partnership.
Terrified. Still am.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
I'm sorry.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
Get out of here!
The key to success is using the right tools.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Because it pays off.
You're giving them to me?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
Jesus.
Right.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
Five million dollars.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Where's Anna?
Lemme see it, will you?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?
Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
Bullshit.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
Show me the document that proves that.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Is that what you want?
Whoa.  No shit.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
And if you had to guess ...
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
You see your office?
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
Have you been to the water board?
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
When?
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
Ten?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
You are someone.
I didn't say that.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
That is not what I'm --
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
More than you need me.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
That's okay.  I understand.
What's going on?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Uh-huh?
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Ben ... Ben ...
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Sit down, and shut up!
I'm going to see what it is.
Does Luke know?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I take it back.
You don't look angry.
How do I look?
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
Where have I heard that before?
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Who's staring?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
That's two you owe me, junior.
Not really.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
I didn't say anything?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Closer?!
He'll survive.
You are reckless!
But I feel The Force flowing!
But tell me why ...
What's in there?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They're...pretending to dress.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
You always were a loser, Plissken. Makin' things up as you go along. That's why I cut out on you in Cleveland. You're just a bum like the rest of us.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
It's history. I gotta go.
The name's Plissken.
Does he know how to activate it?
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Looking to get out.
Hershe. She lives downtown with Mojo Dellasandro in the big boat. Down that way.
Who?
Give me the prototype.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
So be it, to the death.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Speak of the devil!...
In the great book.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
Without Lancelot?!
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
There is one.
We are to blame.
I will run.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
That I cannot.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
In here!
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Just five or six people.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What is it?
Me too.
Sure you won't change your mind?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
What's her name?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
That's good.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
She used those words?
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
Sure did.
He didn't mention her.
I didn't get you?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
You could do it yourself...
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Please.
It's fine really, sit.
In Europe.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Your kidding?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Captain who?
Here I'll show you.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Oh I love you.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
Oh, honey.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
Stealing is a sin.
You just missed them.
Withering Heights.
Ego te abslovo.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
In the face of the enemy.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Who's in it?
...Be gone!!
Yes?
I don't know.
Teeth.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
The fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.
How's the birthday girl?
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
What's the point?
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Thanks.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No thanks.
Says who?
You'll see.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
Yeah, okay.
What?
No?
That how you see it?
That's what we agreed.
It's early.
Sunday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Yeah.
Doesn't it matter to you?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
How long you been at it?
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
Huh?
How come I didn't hear anything?
What disease?
You don't know?
Dignity?  Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Yeah.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, we're not.  Jack?
So she's got a few sniffles.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
We're finished.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
I'll call you.
Job.
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Forget it.
It's okay.  Last one.
Nothing.
You were good.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Oh.
Frank wasn't 'there.
You don't pick your brother.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Not so good.
Eddie.
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Of course he is ...  -- He's yours too.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
For what?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
We need to talk.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Not anymore.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
The Admiral?
Castor's escaped!
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
No problem.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
-- I've got to study.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
Who did?
Check...
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
That’s where you work.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Ringing my bell...
Kate’s my wife...
It’s just two kids, right?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
Yes you do...
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
Basically, it’s my car now.  Get in.
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Thanks.  To you too...
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
What?
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
...my feet are hurtin’...
Do what?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
You had a heart attack?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I’m gonna take you to that special place...
Zeena...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
It’s wonderful...
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Annie goes to a great school.
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
And God love you for it.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Where is he?
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Hey, are you okay?
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
I mean...
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
I can go hotter!
But all these people...
Not this again --
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Hilarious.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Just <u>find</u> him.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Here's the overall Target Area...
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
No...
Message to Proteus.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
What're you getting at?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
No question of her loyalty.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
You mean <I'm> going along?
Attack? Who -- or should I say what from?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Yes...
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
I know only too well what's in the balance, Doctor. And it's not my ego, damned or otherwise.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
You have no right to blame Duval --
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Uh -- what?
Was there any damage?
I'll do what I can.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
No Jean, no money!
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
No.
"No." First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
Yah.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Oh, now he's adorable.
Yah, he -
I unnerstand.
Uh-huh... A what?
Yah.
In what way?
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
No. No, ma'am.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yah, I see.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, how much money was that?
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Okay.
Yah.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
A heck of a lot. What'd you say you were gonna put there?
I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry. Geez, what the heck're you?... Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Oh, yah?
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Uh-huh.
Still missing. We're looking.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Not on your feet too much?
Yah.
Yah.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Well -
Well... Why don't we...
There's no one else here.
Really, what's that?
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
This is... really a shock...
I'd like to thank the academy...
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
What... ?
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
... A person.
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Why would you get bent if I asked?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
Yes.
Who's this?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
Okay, everyone.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
What?
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
Can I stay at your place?
A nice, big cock.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Hum.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Promise?
Shhhhhh!  I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't...
A liposuction clinic.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Work.  Going to work.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
I'm not asking you to.
I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
... is over.
Why did you do that?
What... what are you saying?
It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
...stop me?
You want out?
Not exactly according to plan.
Noooo, please...
I'm doing this for us.
I swear on my life, I won't...
Appreciate something.
What?
What?
My eyes are open.
Very good, Sir.
Don't worry about us, sir.  We're solid.
You told me you'd say that.
Pleeeeeease!
Yesssss...
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
Why?
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
Blow me.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
Who is this guy, anyway?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
He's not a witch.
I'm... really sorry.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
As in flannels and plaids?
Right. April 25th.
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
You saying Tod did kill himself?
What kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
Start over.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Crazy motherfucker.
Let's get that tent down!
Sorry, Sir.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We just take pictures?
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Yeah.  Big time.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Fine.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
Yeah!
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe...  Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
But..How could that happen?
Uh... basement I think...
Tragedy?
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Good.  You believe this drunk?
Fine.  I'll say no.
Which ones?
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Great place huh?
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
They said you're The One.
<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
You really want to help me?
Bingo!
Sure...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
What are the other reasons?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
No just Parry.
Got any Ethel Merman?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
I'm not some piece a crap.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Okay...
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
No. How much do I owe you?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Don't, then.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Tita, I've got to go...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Where's Catherine?!
Swimming?
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Yes, it is!
Yes.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Oh, for pity's sake...
What?
Victor.
I, umm, came to see you.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
C'mon.
Eddie from Compost?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
Okay, then dance. Show.
Who?
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Your friend must be misinformed.
What?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
My God, you're serious.
Fletch...
I'm serious, Sam.
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
What?
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I'd have been long gone.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
What?
What's that?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
How long have they been married?
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
Alan's in Utah.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Why'd you let me in?
Why did you do it?
Yeah.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Lock's busted.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
How gray?
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
Print this Frank.
Jim Swarthout?
Frieda's boss.
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
No, I ain't got you...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
You're not funny.
What?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What?  Jesus, tell me!
What a perv...
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Ye-ah.
Why have you come to my planet?
There's that question...
You need it.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Hey, the poet...
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's yours too!
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Mmm.
What?
Yeah!
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Policy man in Queens.
Yeah.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
What is that old building?
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
What are you saying?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
They around?
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Glad to hear that.
Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
I'm right here behind you...
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Hello?
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
I'm not dreaming.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What's happening?
1998.
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Whatta you mean...
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Whatta we do now?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
What?
What...
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
What the hell is that smell?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
Better.
Nothing you're willing to do.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Close.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
No.  What house you work?
Nah, just working the job.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Where are you going?
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Where's Shelly?
Is that so bad?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Are you all right, Shelly?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Keep looking.
It was nothing.
Who's Horace?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Why?
I wish it was.
Whaddya mean?
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
I could swear I heard...
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Come and get it.
Why?
Huh?
Yes, but they released me because...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
I need to talk to you.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
N...nothing.
June the 19th.
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
That's all right.  I was just...
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
I've told you the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
About Jessica.
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
Tell me.
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
Yeah...a lot.
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
I...I don't know...
Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?
Just radio for help, okay???
The window...
Where you're going, mister?
I opened thousands of brains.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Tonight. What's tonight?
It's just a review.
I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
You say we go?
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Don't wait Efor me.
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
What do you mean?
She was very evasive.
Yes. What are you implying?
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
It can't be all that personal.
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
Why do you need a radio?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
Opening night?
Yes.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
It's your best play, Nicky.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
All right. What's been going on?
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
That's always been my problem.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
One more out.
You're hurting my head.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
Since when did that matter?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
Now that's a complicated subject.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Because life is good.
Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
I was educated by nuns.
Mine was cobalt blue.
A little.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
One more time.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
I don't want you, Steven.
Eleven.
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I'm sorry.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
Panditji -- please, help me.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Ahh.
He's "discovering" India.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's over.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
Again?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
The Mission Director.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
You celebrate, Jerome?
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
News said two persons killed.
That's right.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
It looks fine.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Boring.
That's not all of it.
I'm still here, Doc.
What do we do?
Sure?
What do you want to do?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Twenty eight hundred.
I don't see how.
I'll be ready.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
What about the vault?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I kinda doubt it.
How about twenty thousand?
Go with God.
I know.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
And you told Brumby?
What did he say?
What happened to this car?
Was he?
Never mind.
Why?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's nice.
Doreen.
It's the truth.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Sure I'm sure.
Then he must have pulled her.
Did my brother Frank find out?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
And you didn't know her last name?
No. Frank was a good bloke.
Nobody seems to know.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
Las Vegas.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Will this do?
You're lucky. They kill as well.
You're a bastard.
Yes, thank you.
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Jack Carter.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
Still got a sense of humour?
We've got to take you back to London.
But they have to be diplomatic.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
You're bluffing, you bastard!
They did.
It's not right.
No.
For some sales pro...
Nurses.
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
Just the act.
You don't ax your sales force.
Huh.
No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Have I said that?
Is that what I said?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
I'm sorry?
What if you don't get caught?
Why would they come to me?
...and rob the place...
That's ridiculous.
In the abstract...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I do?
Because you listened.
What do you care...?
Huh?
They're ancient.
He said he filed...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
No, who?
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
You...
Thank you, George.
That they're going to be upset.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Would you excuse us, please.
Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
You have a problem?
All that I'm saying...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
...after the thirtieth...
Murray...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
Because I say so.
Somebody broke in.
Yes.  I hear you.
Why I don't...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
How do you know I made it up?
Well, hadn't it?
Was it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Mmm.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."
And did they steal the contracts...?
You sold eight Mountain View?
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Guess who?
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Did I...?
Yes.
I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act? 
James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not. 
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Of course you have three days.
I don't know.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
What is?
I...
What...?  Say the words.
And the check is...
Not to my knowledge, no...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
To do business.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
What position did you occupy?
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Connie.
Because I need MONEY!
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
No, Dad.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
C'mon, I see what I can do.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Why?
Chi?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Connie's outside.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I asked about Fredo?
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
Wait... there's something else.
And Kay...she's all right?
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
No strings.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Thanks...friend.
Is he related to the witness?
Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
Where?
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Get out of my hotel.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Yes.
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Tea is fine.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Why?
You're sure of that?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
A homo?
No!
Nice place.
The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
All right, I guess.
Go ahead.
This David's a friend?
Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
I liked it.  We all did.
I don't like to talk about that.
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
How long were you...?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Neither of us really belongs here.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
I don't remember that one.
Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
It's too tight.
Need some help?
I think I'll hang around.
The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
Boris?  Do I look a fright?
Oh dear.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
One likes to live simply.
How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
Quite.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Right.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Six years ...
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
What kind of job... ?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
How ya doing?
I don't want him hurt...
Get out --
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
You want to come along quiet?
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
Double-meaning intended --
Hey, Donny --
What color?
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
How you doing, man?
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
And there she is --
It's arright ...
You remember that, Kip?
Whatcha got left ... ?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Okay --
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Come here -
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Things are all leafy and suburban ...
What for -- ?
I gotta get my tool --
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
Are you considering a comeback tour?
No we don't -
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
So she flies -
Not really -
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
Checkin' it out
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
What?
Why would I get into that?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
They don't feel like you're in construction.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
How much?
You know. The stuff I left.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
We did it.  We did it.
There are cops all over the place.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
Yeah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
What kind of person doesn't call?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
Oh shit.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Watch what happens.
Fuck you.
Why not?
She went to Medical school in California.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Yah, it's not a bad school...
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
You caught that, huh?
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
And what do you see?
What is it?
It's touching me.
Really?
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Of course.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
Bullshit.
So who won the bet?
I got your card.
My kind of background?
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Tom.
I won't talk first.
What don't I understand?
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
There is somebody...
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
You're right. I know.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
Watch your mouth.
No.
My wife's dead.
Where were you?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
What?
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
Yes.
Good luck.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
No.
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Exactly.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Clearly.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
I want you to come with me.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Now I can't breathe.
Naw. They paroled me.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
How many men?
How many of you?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
That's the way it is.
Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
No. They wasn't people to write.
What you figger to do?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Naw--not much!
I stay in my own yard.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
But will it--hurt the baby?
Stand by the door.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
Mad, Ma?
Look, Ma!
Didn' you get no sleep?
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
They killed Casy first.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Me an' you both.
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
But what about this?
Man bones?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
You don't...
In the corporate offices.
Whatever I can get away with.
Never better.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
It's nice to see you again.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Bad experiences.
Watched television?
Seven it is.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Right.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Not the other way around...?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I'll hide.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
I just know.
Say more.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
You know where I live?
What stuff?
You understand the psychology of the job.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And they want me to make up for it.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
No, I don't have one.
How are you? How's business?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
You lived in Chicago?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
What?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
I didn't know I had to.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Then why do you want to leave?
Hi.
You're right. Good.
About what?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
My period.
What?
Exactly...
Tch. What are you --
I'm not pretending anything!
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
You're allergic to hay.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
No. I am a "tubab."
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
I was there for that shot, actually.
I'd love to go there one time...
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
Yes, it does.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Ain't brain surgery.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
You're catching on.
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
I understand...
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Yeah, cool.
Alright sir.
Dragon book. Compiler design.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Shh!
I want it.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
It was him, man!
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Joey's getting stupid busy.
Yeah?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
If I win, you become my slave.
Make it my first born.
Make it our first date.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
What?
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
Cancer?
Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
You think they're going to bust us?
What, it left a note?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
So?
555-4202.
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
Don't get angry.
I don't know Brady.
Not without Jamie.
Get back!
Get up there Rachel!
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
I do.
Do you love me Rachel?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
You bet.
In a second.
Come on.
I can't.
Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
Why?
Just do it.
Hi.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
This is 132, over.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
It isn't a man.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Be here in a minute.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
The guys think I'm too smart.
Why did you hang up on me?
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I can't.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Here, Lester.
I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
I'll be here.
Could have...
He isn't a man.
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
I'll check back in an hour.
You all right?
They could be.
I found the car! He's here!
Totally.
Okay. Later.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the bogyman?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Was it the bogyman?
You're coming with us...
Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Will you get her for me?
I've given them his profile.
If you say so.
Come in, come in.
Oh.
Mmm.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Yeah.
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Uh-huh.
And it ruins everything else.
Well...
It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Uh-huh.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yes?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
What are you doing?!
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Oh, don't say those words!
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Why?
Oh, my God.
Oh, all the time.
No.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
That's where your talent lies.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
I want one with you.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Are you in love with someone else?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
I am glad to see you.
Always.
Oh, honey!
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Because I have to!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Jesus...Jesus!
But you don't have any symptoms!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
I bumped into your...
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
How are you?
Really?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
He's fine.
Yeah?
Football!
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
I'd have been a great dope addict.
Okay.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh!
Oh, yeah. 
Singing?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Uh-huh.
Look, everything's going your way.
So what's new?
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Oh, so loosely.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
No!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
Oh.  Oh.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Well, what about me?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Hi.
Hi.  How you doin'?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
April?
...read it over, and think about it.
...you don't have to think.
Some museum director disappeared.
I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
...very good.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
And who is "they?"
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
...these guy'll back you up.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...his family has offered a large reward.
...would you excuse me...?
They got that kind of money?
Their family owns...
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Seen what, sir..?
You give me whatever I want...?
I've never heard that he...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Try Barney Clark.
...here's to child abuse!
Why?
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...how so?
I'll have them picked up.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
...and my need for The Institution...
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
...what has she done to harm you...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
...what?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I know where he is.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
It would seem.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
...would you use a small word?
Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
...yes...?
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I hope so...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
You're all making me blush...
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...

That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
Don't talk to me like that.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
Sure.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
Did not.
You didn't say Simon Says.
May<u>be</u>.
What's that?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Look who I've found!
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
What now?
Bye.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
Saint Mario!
God, yes!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Second most common?
Eighty third most common.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No.
What was it?
I understand... I won't-
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Just get better okay?
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
I quit. Today's my last day.
Yeah? You and who else?
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
What's the difference?
What's that?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Really? Why?
No please make yourself at home.
Thanks.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Two.
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
What things do you think you've done?
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
What do you mean?
You.
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Me!
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
JOEY!
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Gale...
You do?
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
She's talking to him now.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
What?
Dad!
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
-- hospital.
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Who doesn't?
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Sure.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
I'm thirsty.
Aw, okay.
Uh huh.
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
That's okay, Mom.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
And it's a shorter commute.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
What?
What?
He made, you know, a remark.
No.
There's no card or anything.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
Where should I hide the car keys?
No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
The thermometer's broken.
And I can't help having a cold.
Can we keep him?
Right over here.
Promise.
Not now.  I'm busy.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
He had to come from somewhere.
Congratulations.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Aye.
That's all?
The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
No -- after you.
How?
I lied.
You'll no see me again.
What are you hoping to find inside?
What do you want?
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
Conner?
His head.  Someone cut it off.
I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
How can that be?
Me too.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I'll no forget you.
Yes.
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
You think we should take that chance?
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
I'm going to my desk.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
I'll give you these people.
Okay.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
They'll cut the power.
Dennis.
Okey-doke.
I don't eat junk food.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
You'd better be kidding.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
You sure?
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
I know.
We can't make the microwave work.
Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Holster your guns!
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Maddox!  You got that?
Order your men to stand down.
What?
Where's the office?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
I'm sorry, it's a private function.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Leave it to me.
Where is your family?
How many in your family?
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
What's happening?
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
I led no massacres.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
That will take time.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
You have our cards.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
Of course.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Your brother's here?
Of course.
We must do something.
Dawn. Then they go.
Get in.
How can we help him.
What about us?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Do as I say. I will be there soon.
You cannot go alone.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
What?
No! Sit down now.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Why?
What's wrong?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
The lieutenant wants the register.
How much beer?
Thank you, sir.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Thank you, Roger.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Where?
Go downstairs, I will help you.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
Not yet.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
Not at all!
I'm moved beyond words.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
-- fuck you!
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Nothing.
Yes.
And we get this money when?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Why?
You need to get out more.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Let's try down here...
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
I don't do groups.
I'm not laughing, Steven.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Where is she?
Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
-- my loss --
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
I think I'll do what I damn well please.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
It works.
He must've beaten us all here!
Why not?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Something....happened --
What's the matter?
What was her name?
A few years older, perhaps.
How's your arm?
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
No it won't - no it won't!
Where is she now?
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
For good luck honey.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Don't be afraid!
Oh come on...
I don't know.  That's strange.
Well what do you think it is?
Oh come on!
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
I'm all right...
Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Yes, I am.
How can I help you?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
What?
I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
What can we do?
Then tell me what to do.
It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Right.  Right!
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
JP?
You're apologizing?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
You re not thinking of going to...
You can be lookout!.....  Take Alex's gun.
Too-do-loo, babe.
I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
You're supposed to be dead!
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Yeah.  The big E.
He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
How long were you in?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Wha.....
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
We're here to say, your government was right.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Yes.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Alchemy.
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Why George, you big softie...
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Well, maybe I --
It's hardly the same --
Smitty.
...Huh?
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
Your i --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Oh Norville, I --
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
This I know, Benny.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?! But, buddy --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
...adenoids.
Thank you for waking me.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Thank you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
But she's not dead, Wes.
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
I'm sorry...
Good morning.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Yes.
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
And as usual no one believed me...
Why shouldn't she be?
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Good night.
What do you think?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Sure dad.
Gotcha.
I just can't believe you could be so --
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
A key party?
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Mikey Williams?
Mom. Are you ok?
Oh Wendy.
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
It'll warm you up.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Yes.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
I don't have a girlfriend.
Out.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
I dunno. I --
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
Don't worry about him...
Do it again.
Good.  He's up next.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Around twelve-thirty.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
How do you mean?
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
You don't know.
Best friend?
Since grade school.
Thought you wanted something fun...
You don't know.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Then so was mine...
No.
I have not spoken to him...
If you say so. You are innocent.
We can do that?
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
How he must have loved you.
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Stop her Louis!
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
We forgive each other then?
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
The swamp...
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
It's only mortal death.
Why should I be?
Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You have fed. You were made for this...
The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
I don't know any hell -
Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Lestat, what do you mean?
You can't look at them...
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
And you know what you ask for?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
A child who can't die...
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
But, he said he'd try.
Karla! You promised.
I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Some.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
Ray, we're just friend.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Can't what?
It's okay.
Who?
I don't know.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
I guess so.
Why?
Yes!
Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
He leave you?
How's the water?
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
I'll go find him.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
Drunk again?
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently —— walked blindly.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
Closer and closer —- until they bite into your throat!
Shh——— it's all right -— I'll be all right.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
Yes?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Oh, now —— now look here ——
When you make sense I'll listen.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
I hate to do this, fella.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Angel, Second Class.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
No!
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Today, over at the house.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.
Goodbye, Sam.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Oh, stop that grunting.
Hmmm . . .
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
No.
Ummmm . . .
Huh?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Some other time, George.
How do you do.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
I don't like coconuts.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Beautiful.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Ummmmm . . .
In that place?
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
How's that?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
Darling, you're wonderful.
To keep from being an old maid.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
I'm supposed to.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Yee-hah!
What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
I need a hand here....
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Sailing?
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
You heard me.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
You don't make enough.
The whale's mouth?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Is there one in these waters?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And sound.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Home it is.
MMMmmmorning....
Mrs. Silvera.
It's an island.  Got to run.
For me?
No.
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Just one minute....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
I want you to meet my cousin.
Help!  Help!
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
I can't stop thinking!
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Until we find something.
I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
Great.  I got some wine.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Sean, baby, please....
When are we going out?  You and me?
Not tonight.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I want to go with you!
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
You don't.
What's up?
... Mean through the tubes?
Hydrophobia...
Michael, take deep breaths.
Me.
I am.  You're not.
You don't have to prove anything.
What in hell is that?
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
Brian, he's coming around!
How'd it get in here?!
She, Mister Hutton.
They still seem nervous.
Ten minutes ago.
I should have never listened to Calvin.
Sure.  No problem.
Are you really?
Sure am.
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Take it up.
Yeah, well I didn't!
Yeah, poor bastard.
All right, hit those lights too.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Don't bother Hoagie....
It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Turn it off....
I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
But it went away...We would have known....
Where is she?
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
I'm not doing anything.
Can't help myself....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
Thanks for the consultation....
You were a monkey....
Mom, please don't start that again....
I am.
No.
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
You got a better idea...?
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
I made them, man....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Holy shit!
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
No way....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
Here it comes....
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
I'm training to....
Anything to do before I go home?
The van?
Is it your vehicle?
How'd you do it, old man?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
You want me to stop the car?
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
Sure.
You don't really believe this?
No .. You didn't know that ..
How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Now?
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
That's bullshit,
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Wrong cabinet.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
No.
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
Do you pray?
Really? What did he say?
Just your age.
Why?
Why?
You find something curious in that?
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Whass going on here?
He has? .. What's he doing here?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
One of the accountants.
Ugh!
You are not a loser.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Could you just stop moving?
There is something missing here.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
You're imagining it.
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Good idea.  Thank you.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Don't worry about it, boss.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah, what happened there.
Okay... I will...
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Thank you.
Yes.
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Oh my God.
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
Great word.  Towel?
Forget it.  Forget it.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
How do I know?
Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
I'm a little worried --
You don't want to go home, do you?
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Go.  Flee.
What --
Well.  Good luck with that --
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
Pleasure.
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Jerry --
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
No.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
I'm scared.  What is it?
I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
This is how you play God.
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
That one time was just the bumper.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
He could have died.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
I don't think so.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
A well-accepted theory.
Mine's new.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
You're right.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
What are you talking about?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Well, is he?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Okay.
How close do you have to be?
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
She's nuts.
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
I think she's with Sarah!
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
What?!
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
I'm trying!
No.
Can the kid walk?
Damn!
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
'Bout thirty seconds.
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Yeah, I know.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Alan!
What are we looking for?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
Tim.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
No.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
For a further three years.
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
What does he mean by "target audience"?
I'll stay awake.
You're a beautiful big animal.
Don't do that!
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Thanks, Steve.
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
That didn't sound very convincing.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Great.	When can you do it?
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
How's that possible?
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
In a manner of speaking.
Yes.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Did you see him?
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I do.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
One of you must be mistaken.
No.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
And you ...?
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
What makes you think so?
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
No! Don't!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Yeah.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
Yes indeed.
Yes -- all right --
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
You said that.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Gee.
Honest?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
I can't say he was anybody!
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
No.
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
You said you wanted these.
Try some other ways. 
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Then, close the case.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Did she talk about him to you?
I think she's trying that.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
He's in his room, playing.
Not particularly.
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
In real life when does he hit you?
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
I guess...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
That's okay...
I'm sorry...
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
No, she never did.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I don't understand, daddy.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Did you wish to?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
And what is your present salary?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
No.
Yes.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
You've been living here, in the city?
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
What?
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
She'll be back...
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Kramer...
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Three months.  How can you tell?
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Any prospects?
I don't know.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
No.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
What d'you tell her?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
You and Charley?
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
No!
And we will begin with tearing it down.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
I do not know, Holiness.
When it is time.
Britain?
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Ahh.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
Bastard bit my chopper.
You ready on shore?
You do?
<u>Hector</u>.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
What?
I'm sorry but you're...
Excuse me?
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Night.
We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Good idea.
You wanna ride in my truck?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Is the dead guy in there?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
And this is how he came to the boat?
What kind of backup do we have?
<u>We</u>?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
It looks like a branch.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Yes.
He said he knew Karate!
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
You and Kevin.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
Hot damn, Clarice.
I will... I promise.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
I understand.
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Starling -
Good idea.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
Point taken.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Sewing...
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
All that detail, just from memory...?
How many women has he used, our Bill?
All flayed...?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Mmm. And what else...?
Killed outright?
I - ran away...
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
So you ran away...
You know I can't make that promise.
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Thank you so much.
Sorry to disappoint you...
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Miss.  May I?
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
Yes. I want you to go.
My letter...
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
It can be dangerous...
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
We were headed...
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
: Only one or two loads.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
That's all, sir.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
You forget yourself!
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Was there such a thing?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
What has?
Crunch...Implosion.
Shit...
Why can't we pick up his signal?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
Sixpack...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
DeJesus...It's got him.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
It's hit us all hard!
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
I'll think of something, don't worry.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Good, you can get this under control now.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
Yes?
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
Let's have a look, shall we?
Sure is.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
All right, Kenny.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Just give me the keys.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
What do you mean, me?
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
Well, perhaps you can help?
You know it doesn't include the amp.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
How many wings have they got between them?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Oh, come on, Amado--
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Catholic school, nasty.
I-I can do the job, sir.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
You really want to know, sir?
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
We were just dancing--
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
That's in Maverick County.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Do I seem jumpy?
Yeah, well--
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Best part of the job.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
The Trail of Tears.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Tanks, huh?
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
He does.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Lead mine.
It's a lead mine.
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
You know who it was they dug up?
Good deal you were born down here, then.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Take that pair over in the corner--
Yeah. I bet he would.
Have we had trouble there before?
Substance abuse?
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
And people make their choice--
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
We was crossin' the river--
This girl has a child?
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He still living?
Charley Wade.
I got an idea what happened.
Hey, Sam.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Steve?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You told me one time it was true love.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Okay? He's not here?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
What was your deal with him?
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
How come?
How much you got left?
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Are you okay?
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Amado.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah.
Two years.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Uh-huh.
They got telephones.
Yeah.
Well, it's a complicated issue--
Just doing my job.
Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Thirty-five bucks.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Be ready.
You don't?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Does that mean...?
Sure.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
He was the real thing, right?
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
Nothing you don't want.
And they all came...
It's okay.
Hang on!
...yes?
I... have... to.
Harry-?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I'd like to hear them.
Go away.
Then what do you want?
A ticket home,
What for?  You need to stay busy?
No.
Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
The Puritan?
Who is he?
Harry D'Amour.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
Sure.  Vivovich.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
Jesus!
Can you do it?
I don't know.
Who is she?
Maybe... I... don't...
Is he the Puritan?
You'll do it?
What do you do?
Thanks.
I know, it's stupid.
I know.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Because that would be too easy.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
We should get you to the doctor.
You think so?
Thanks.
Can I enter?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Uh, no.
Not all that pasta.
Hello?
It's ok.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Ok.
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
That's ok.
Its bad for you.
Are you sure you have to go?
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Bad?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I believe in you.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Eight.  That okay?
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
I hope so.
You killed my parents.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Peter Kelson?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
I had to.
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What's the...OH SHIT!
You have to say that.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Not a lot.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
We millionaires yet?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
Where is she now?
Nothing.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
He's still at the bank.
I can manage.
Engaged.
Whatever.
There you go.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
You sure?
Are you okay?
I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You're cold?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
Shh.  It's okay.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
I know...
What?
Dad.  What are you doing here?
But?
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
I wouldn't know.
Lucky.
Uh huh.
I just can.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
Man, forget you then, stupid.
I know this.  What do you want?
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Big-ass titties?
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Your hot-ass temper.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
You sure?
What'd it say?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
She understands.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
You forgot to be there.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
You're what?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Oh yeah?
Figured it was something like that.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
A rest?
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Better late than never, right?
Your heart.
At one in the morning?
I have.
Okay.
I've been hearing you.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
You know, people.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Good.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
In my sleep, Burt.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
GET OUT.
I'm coming!
Did you hear what I said?
It's fine.
You just move in here?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
The gentleman who came to the door --
Thank you.
yeah, good, ok.
Eight o'clock?
Bye.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
ok.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
You mind if I come in, check things?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Leave this one to the detectives, they ain't gonna solve shit, I can help you, make you the man with a plan, give you the gift that I flow -- think fast -- you wanna know who killed that guy?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
I'm about to get off the elevator --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
Braces.
Braces?
Yes I do.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Yeah.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Where is he?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Frank Mackey.  That's your son?
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
....getthat on the tv....there...
You got us a room so quick?
-- let's talk more about your background --
Are you asking me that?
Yes.
Not really.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Around here.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
He passed away.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Uh. huh.
yeah.
I am calm.
And what about screaming?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
I didn't hear anything.
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Fuck no.
-- did she talk to you?
No one else that I know?
Two years...three years...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
No.
Are you her boyfriend?
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
No they don't --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
I have to go.
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
Yeah.
What would you like?
Do you have that?
Yes. What? Yes.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Yes.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
It's not right.
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
I am with you!
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Yes, and he has a choice!
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
You can do it.
But -- what is Porthos doing?
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
You're a fool!
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness?
It is also a place of burial.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
I am unhurt --
It's lovely.  It's just...
If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
You mean shut your ass down!
Where are you?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
Right behind you.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Yeah?
Up north.
No, but I'm listening.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
I killed them.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
A bank?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Screw him!
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You look all right now.
These are all dead, Will.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Wait, Will...
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
This is our boy...!
How far away's the back-up?
It's happening again, Jack...
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
He went to the men's room.
Uh-huh.
I'm fine.
No.
No!
Was I in an accident?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Yes.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Not me.
You'll let me go now?
Dr. Chilton.
No.
Where did you get it?!
Hi, Linda. ..
I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
'Intimate? !"
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
Blue, then.
I love you...
Will...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Thanks.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Stuart is fine.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I hope you have a second chance...
That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
But wasn't it funny?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Tony Clifton.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Okay.  You're probably right.
It's so dirty.
What is this, World War Two...?
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
Don't believe everything you hear.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
They're gonna lynch him!
What's your name?
You all look the same to me.
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
How?
Any time.
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Yes.  Now.
Go!  Now!
The agents --
Far from it.
And she knows what?  Everything?
Yes.
That's why we're here.
Morpheus, I don't know --
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
What is the Matrix?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
... shit.
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Where is it?
How?
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
I can't!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Look fella...this is private...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
That means it's good.
You got sparklers?
You sure?
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Yeah.
You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Don't be smart.
Mind your own business.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Get him in.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
No.
Ok.
Watch your language.
Yeah, I think so.
I know...I know.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Of course.
Who's Annie?
What will I tell Annie?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Then why did you bring it up?
The dagger --?
What'd it say?
Sounds good.
Do you think I need a haircut?
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
How nice for you both.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
I from dat nex' place.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can't, sistah.
The Board is waiting.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Are you?
Thanks.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Whatever you do.
And I'll be a visitor.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I mean I appreciate that.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
No.
And is your heart beating strangely?
More than you love peanut butter?
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Don't.  That will come later.
You think so?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
'Threw' you?  Where?
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Sounds fair enough.
What do you mean?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
It's all yours.
Okay.
Goodnight.
What's okay?
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Get him in here.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An offense --
Death!
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
How did you know?
Aw, you're tough.
Raise away.
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Daddy --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
You and 'Honey'?
I would.
Why?
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
I think I know her.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
What's it like?
That's right I did, didn't I?
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
Where'd you get it?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Quiet!
You told me.
She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
There are things you know for sure.
Where is he?
How?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
It's good.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I don't remember.
I'll be waiting.							   *
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
How do you know this?
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Are you sure?
No. You took them out.						  *
Lemon or lime?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Recruit us to do what?
Good.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Tell them what you want.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Deal.
Where's that?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Died in childbirth, having me...
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
'Cause she will tell you.
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Five minutes...
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
Then you should.
Detective Crockett.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Have faith.
Alonzo...!
White supremacist types.
He did volunteer one time...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
...and thanks for the flowers.
What flowers?
What would you do...?
Do we need this...?
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Yeah?
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
I mean, dammit, where you live?
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I'm wet.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Is he all right!
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
...He had a bald skull and...
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Where?
Twenty months?
Yeah. How's Mom?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
Twelve years.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
What?  You gotta be joking.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
There's some weird shit here.
Take a look.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
No, you talkin' at me.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Don't get kinky here...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Try not to sweat?
Jump in.
Oh, Jesus.
What is it?
No shit.
What?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I'm not much of a critic.
--my number one fan.
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
No, what is it?
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Then who did?
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I can't write this anymore.
I'm telling you, I can't.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
A toast?
Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
You don't know?
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Yes.
So do I...
Buster.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
No, the typing kind.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Where is it?
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
Well, that's good, isn't?
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
More like two-two point two million.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Exactly where is she?
..in the building...
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
I am. She is.
What if I pay the rent?
Uh-huh?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Oh, either way works for me.
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Ethan, tell me -
He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
It's going to be okay.
Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.
Like?
You were there.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
..not in time to save him.
Yep.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
What kind of show.
May take a little time.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
What happened to Jim?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
You're sure about this?
Sure...
Bastard!
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I'll get you close.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Why should I?
What about Job?
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Keep counting Claire.
Of course I can hear you.
Loud and clear.
Why don't you take a look?
Try it again.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
And I'll have the special fish.
What?
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Bed.
You're not sleepy?
Ti amo.
I won't come.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
You're married.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
I'm going to marry him.
How'd he die?
Bus hit him.
How many men since then?
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
Don't just become excited.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
You don't get along with anybody!
You ruined my life.
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
What are you talking about?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Alright. Where's the Met?
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
He didn't come!
We're here.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
She was too young for him.
Never is a long time.
This is a good suit.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Then let's set the date.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
And who's gonna pay for that?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Your hair's different.
Where's pop?
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
She recovered.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I don't know.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Yes.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
What happened?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Marriage is happy news.
Cosmo.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Who are the Britons?
You don't vote for kings.
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
One that looks nice.
What?
So be it!
Well, what's that then?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Bedevere, my Liege.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
OF course, my Liege ...
I am an enchanter.
A G...g...g...
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
Behind the rabbit?
What?
You got us all worked up.
... Well, we did do the nose.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
What is your name?
What is your quest?
I think I could pull through, sir.
Gosh - Is he all right?
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
How?
We're coming with you.
Why?
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, I'm not.
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I didn't.
Seventy a year.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
The good-looking one.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
It's a diary.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Good man.  And is she all right?
I see.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Convey her a message.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm not married.
Oh.
I do what I do.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
See what?
You are here safely.
Aye, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
What does he know about the Highlands?
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
Aye.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I'm breaking no promises!
Oh, several things.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
So?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Excellent!
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Read it!
Why not?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Maybe he's not dead.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
What the hell are you talking about?
Sure.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
Then where do we go?!
And beat it at it's own game.
We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Everything.
Put in a quarter.
You have no time.  What is your question?
But I don't understand...
Yes...but...how did you...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
Sign me up.
They fired everyone.
What do you mean "you know"?
And?
You're broke!
The Cowboy??
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Before what?
But it said #12.
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
Good luck!
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
The one of 'em still alive?
Oh yeah.
Find out who they are?
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
I'm working on it.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Excuse me ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
Let's go.
That's a shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Just shut the fuck up.
Because of my charming personality ?
Not quite....
What the fuck are you talking about.
Thanks...
But, he's...
When you are ready.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
I am thirty two.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Aren't you the bitter one.
I can see that but where ?
Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
Thank you.
Excuse me, gentlemen
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
As appealing as that sounds...
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Shut up ! It's me.
Good morning.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
You're Vada right?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
I would do it again in a minute.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
I figured you did.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously.
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
Come on in!
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Rose.
O.K. Thank you very much.
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Don't wake up Vada.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
You would.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Give it to me!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Ten bucks.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
This is it I guess.
Okay.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
You know how I feel about you.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Not exactly.
Bye Niece, Vada.
I mean...with your car.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
I was commenting on your hair.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Oh, sure okay.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Okay.
Kinda like men.
What happened to her?
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Yes.
Okay.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Why?
No sweetheart, you can't.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
There were just too many of 'em.
Oh come on.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
This is one big house for one single person.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Do you think she is?
Why?
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
What are they about?
Sure.
Come here, sit down.
Hi.
Uh huh, why?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
Where's Daddy?
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
They're just fun to read.
What are you saving for?
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Okay, OW!
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
I am not.
What?
You're right, let's knock it down.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I don't like her.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Close your eyes.
What?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
I have a suggestion...
I can see why.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
That was Thursday.
I can't even say it.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
He said that, too.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Let me rephrase that...
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Ju...
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Don't you see...
That's entirely understandable.
... Thomas, yeh.
Hate that.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
She finds him "personable."
What, leaving school...
I got the point.
I never eat when I'm serene.
Michael!!
If you like.
It's more than that.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It means a lot.
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I came here, looking for her.
That is so romantic.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Well, it better not happen again.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Then why are you listening to her -
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Green.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
His Word.
Barbara Jean.
What!
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. Come on in. Mary!
ABC.
To the bathroom.
I'm not really a musician.
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
He's a member of our congregation.
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
I have to go. He sighs.
Oh.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What...?  0h, yes.
Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
How much?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Depends on what I'm studying.
I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
Where are you from?
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
That's what Tim said.
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
What did you think then?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Are we in a big hurry?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
You've heard of it?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
By all means.
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Yes, sir.
Do you have a back up.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Yes.
That's the way of the world.
Just for fun, I guess.
Where do the air ducts lead?
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
How so?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Really?
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I can't do that. Five guys.
They done that too long in my family.
Okay.
Well, what d'you know?!
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Okay.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Okay.
I don't know.
Well, he worked around.
Okay.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
In Birmingham.
How d'you mean?
No thanks.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
Good night, Duff.
Why did you?
That's the way he is.
Four.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
What about that girl?
No. But a small one.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
We'll be all right.
How come you keep askin'?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
Duff--
What's so hot 'round town?
How 'bout the key?
I bet she's easy jam.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Yeah. That's right.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Going back, huh?
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I doubt it.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
'Musta knocked her up.
He's my son!
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Shut up, Will.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
Like hell you ain't!
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
Since when?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
No. I only needed the code from you.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
And how do you suggest I do that?
What does this have to do with me?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
I find out now.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
It's Case. Remember me?
What?
Can you take me to it?
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
It's coming.
Where did you here that?
I think you're full of shit.
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Hold on.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
No Roger from op/ed?
Nope.
If you say so.
You stood for like a month.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Okay. That's bad.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
By Guy?
Betty.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Kristen got a quote?
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
I can't do this.
Rob. Please focus.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Little known fact.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Thanks. And what are -
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Sorry. Forgetful.
You like her?
You remember that story?
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Well, are you here with anybody?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We're very evolved.
For this.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Yes.
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
Just out for a while.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
It's not the gas, Dad!
Oh, please...
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
Naw. Just killing time.
What the hell are you talking about?
They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
Shut up, Grady.
I'm sorry...
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
I don't know.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Making friends?
Fine.
Yor dad picking the music again?
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
A little basic, but nice.
Restless.  Very restless.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Doesn't matter.
Everybody take five.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Of course.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
No.
Oh right.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
That's fine.
I was.
Ahm...
You've got to go.
Come in.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
What do you think?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
Right.
You and every person in this country.
Oh.
Damn, I forgot the jam.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Who is it?
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
And this is William.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Yes.  What do you think?
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Any bit in particular?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Can I help you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
So not over her, in fact.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Hi...
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Sort of.
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
And you get on very well.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
No! No! No!
Yes, ma'am.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
On this ward?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Wow! They're so quiet.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Yeah!
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Me too...
My feet hurt...
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
Sure, Mack...
Why not?
When?
Who told you that?
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Hold it a minute.
He's not!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
You bet, Doc!
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
'Kay, Mac!
You look pretty healthy to me.
All right!
What's going on?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
No...
Thank you, ma'am,
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Take you han's offa me!
Why, sure, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
No.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
You're sure...
What is it?
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Sa dov'e' lui?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
Mickey Spillane.
What are you doing here?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
GET OUT!!
There is no us.
Uh huh.
Just since yesterday.
Well, not exactly...
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Is he married?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know...  It was.
What about your job?
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
My God, you have...
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
A phone message.  Only--
Right.  My brother.
Because I'm the one who's single.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
What?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
And Larry?...
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
I thank you.
Giovanni.
No, why?
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Mania.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
Sure we keep records!
What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
It'll do.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
In a minute.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
See! You don't understand!
What makes him so special?
Which side are you with?
I better see you get there.
I want to be a teacher.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
I really don't know.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
The things that go on.
Oh she's a beauty.
No thanks... .
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
I don't rate it.
Told him what?
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Who is he, Pop?
See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myself—this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
You are like—
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
What are you going to do?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
You go to—
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Such as what?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Hit me again.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Thanks, Johnny... .
Listen, Johnny—
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
One of these days.
In there.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What can we do?
I'm afraid I'll faint.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
You do?
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
It would seem so, Master.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
For what!?!
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Who is it?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
Yes.
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Yes.
Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
Shit.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Sure looks that way.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
Or two.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I get that feeling, yeah.
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
What'd you talk about?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
You don't act like it.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Yeah...
None of your business.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
How far do we go with this?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why are you mad?
I don't know.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
It works.  You should try it sometime.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
The flight?
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
I'm freezing my ass off.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
How you know that?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Oh, he's moved out?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
No thanks.
No, he looks a lot...
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
My little girl, the tough babe.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Still...
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
No, I was.
Too late for apologies, Walker.
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
I got a half a tank.  You?
Home of the brave.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Home of the Brave.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Yeah.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Well...sure.
Hang on.
Then wh-where do we land?
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Sorry to trouble you.
Respect.
You too, Lieutenant.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Fook ya!
Learn English, then!
Good—bye, Grandma.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
I can't. It's all too much.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
He does?
That's disgusting!
I know. Put Scott through college.
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Come on, let's dance.
You really love me, don't you?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
What the hell is that?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Have a nice day.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Terry! Slow down.
But I'm remembering the future.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
You don't?
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Open it.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
For what?
I'm just happy to see you.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
I don't know.
Am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Give me some credit, will you?
When do we start?
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
Yes... why?
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
I'm not hungry.
He pissed me off.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
There's a better place...
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
Drew!
Whatever.
A carrot?!
I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Continue.
Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
They didn't fire her?
Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
Except... you were gay?
I still am.
What do you love about it?
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
Do you take risks?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Thank you. No more questions.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Get real.
That's correct.
Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Who?
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Now that you mention it...
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Beckett?
Helloooo...
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Charles...
He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
They're coming.
But I just wanted to say --
Get out of our way.
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
Let's drop back an' boot up.
You sure you can keep --
Riddick? How close?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
I would try for them.
Possibly.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
25 kilos each, huh?
60 years ago.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
What?
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Not staying in here another....
Looks clear.
No. She's not.
Don' look, don' look, don' look....
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
What, it's broken?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
No, they won't -
The evidence was very meager --
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Hmph.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
To Earth! That we've landed!
long pause) You know it.
Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Okay.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
What about it?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Which one?
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Where?
Yeah, what is it?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
That's a nice way of putting it.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
You really think so... us?
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Vancouver, B.C.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
Well..
I'm sure you have.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
How long would that take?
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Sure... but somebody always does..
That's all there is.
Certainly not to me.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Couldn't be.
You don't know who he is?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
No percentage in that.
They'll look for you.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Killaine...
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You were there when I last saw him.
If I understand what you meant by that.
You understand perfectly.
Very ridiculous.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
But even if you were in love with me.
Sometimes.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
You asked for it.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
A thousand.
Why not here?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
You're not English.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
I wouldn't know.
No idea.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
How would you know, Brandon?
Thank you.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Let me know when you've identified him
Would you?
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Well.  What about it?
So?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Did you ever have a serious operation?
It does.  May I go now? 
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
Now, you're being beastly.
So far.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Ye have, have ye?
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I have a rough idea.
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
I say YES!
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
It's kind of you to see me.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
What went wrong?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Keep me company.
Of course.
I'll have some of that.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Who?
In radio we're different.
That'll be fun
Nonsense.
To the Fleet.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
Will it be fun?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
Hello.
I'm waiting for your mother.
They don't count.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
That's good.
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
What would you call it?
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
Now listen...
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Promise.
No.
Not yet.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
No.
Zero distortion, sir.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Figured you did.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Catch of the day.
Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
You're kneeling on my hand.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
No way, old buddy.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
We both got scores to settle.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
Thank you, Sergeant.
The best friend I ever had.
It's been a long time, General.
I can't tell.
Where the hell is his body?
He knows our defenses.
They never are, dear.
I talked to some developers about the land.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
You've got a lot of nerve.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
You're making the right decision, sir.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Sit... and spin.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
You're not from L.A., huh?
For an hour.
Fine.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Fair enough.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
What?  Why?
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Five full nights... days too?
Holy shit.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Was someone rude to you?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Good.
Dinner can wait.
Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Ready to stomp sod?
I really am sorry.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
But don't they have it in English?
Did you?
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Vivian...
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
But, Edward...
Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Goodbye, Bill.
Why?
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
All this because of that whore!
I bet.  That was our rent!
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Was that you?
I leave extras, miss.
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Will I like it?
I like steak.
Professionally?
Me?
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
Yes...
I don't think it would fit you.
'Scume me.
I was in here yesterday.
I just might do that.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Should I be?
As you wish.
As you wish.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
I thought I was going faster.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Have you any money?
I hope we win...
What is it?
Has it got any sports in it?
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
And our assets?
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Light him.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated
Thank you.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Okay.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A good hour. Yeah.
What?
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Well, sir, it seems ...
But that's cheating!
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
What did I do?
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
To failure!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Yes.  We would!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on.  Let's get going.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Oh, the best one.
I shall count the minutes.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
Bismark...
The Blue Max...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
What?
Very early. Dawn.
No one met her?
No.
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Cash or check? For the cabin...
Not at all!
If she paid you well?
Who are you, friend?
Sam, if she's here...
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Where?
What's the matter?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
Maybe we can handle it together. 
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
In a hurry.
Of course we will.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
I'm thinking of it.
Don't miss your plane.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
A man should have a hobby.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
That's it. 
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
No need to apologize...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Have you two had breakfast?
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Come on, we're wasting time.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
There's no child here.
No?
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
I'm not quarreling, only ...
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
What do you think I am?
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
And they never proved anything against him.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Now don't that call for an extra!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
How's every little thing?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
I see. Was that all she said?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Oh, is that what caused it?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
Excuse me???
I could go out of town.
Where to?
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
I know, Mother.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
You were pretty bad, huh?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
But Rose...
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Let me see!
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Here comes Daddy.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Yeah, they're in the snow.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
I'm not blubbering.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
Well, it's Billy.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Yes, sir.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
You can stop it right now.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
But... I love him.  I do...
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Again.
What'd I say?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
We'll share.
No you can't.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Shit.  You're right.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Oh yeah?
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Dead.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
You cannot escape your destiny.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
Yes, my Master.
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Leia!
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
You love him, don't you?
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
We shall double our efforts.
Red Leader standing by.
Your Royal Highness.
Oh, no.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
But, why must you confront him?
Never-r-r!
Yes.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
So please don't tell me to can it.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Weiss.
I hope so my darling.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
From Transexual Transylvania.
No no no no.
Oh, lucky him.
The delivery boy.
...I'm sorry.
Absolutely.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...No thanks.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
It did.
-- The legs.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
Yeah, I can't beat him.
What're we going to do?
I can't go out.
That so.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
Get that doctor.
You're hurtin', man!
...Stop jivin'!
...Still don't feel no heat.
No wine.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Few minutes?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Cost ya a buck.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
What's happenin' here?
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
That's it? -- Completely?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
No -- Just me.
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
Please, kid.
Check the eyes, Ben.
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
It ain't your locker no more.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Yo, Paulie.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
...Sure.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
It don't bother me none.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
What can I do about it?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
That was the idea.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Aah!
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Uh? Uh?
Then I'll leave thee.
Farewell, my cuz.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
He shall be endured
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Romeo, come forth.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Goodnight.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
I am for you.
Is she a Capulet?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
From Interpol?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I still am.
Nobody's saying they don't.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
I'd stake my reputation.
There's a problem...
Shut up!
Do you have the material?
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
You'll die if you leave here.
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Sent it where?
Then I guess we're set.
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Of course.  Don't you?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Not for long.
Why don't you go do better, then...
What a surprise...
I don't think so.
Things.  This is my country, you know.
To see a man about a thing.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
I've seen a lot of people die before.
I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
Do what?
Dark ops?
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Closest and oldest.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
What?
I know.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
You sure?
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
None of them had any --
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
Because...I know.
Torch it?!
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
It's NOT too late!
Uh huh.
Rock solid.
Shut up, Jesse.
What's that?
No.  But he would, probably.
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
He's not, he's...
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I don't know, Booth.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
A week ago, at most.
Sounds like you don't trust me.
What?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
It certainly is...
Dwayne -
You'd do this to me!
Oh Jesus Christ...
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Well I don't know --
Absolutely positively.
Anything in it?
So...what's the good news?
I'm not getting an answer.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
I'd like to see you try.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
You bring American money?
No.  It's my first time.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
Well, hurry up.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
And you ain't black!
Who died?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
What did you say?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
It's your turn!
There's people up here!
It's a bomb.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
Yes.  We have heaven.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Are you serious?
Who's Benjamin?
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
What?!?!
We have to get to the Penthouse.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Any leads?
Thank you.
OK. Say what it is.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
Yeah, it's good.
It's him.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What?
The Feds?!
It's called a dress.
Not to me. Never to me.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
You a cop or something?
Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Han?
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
You bet ya, Coach.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
Thank you.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Still sweet.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
No.
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Bob will be very happy.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Me?
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Yup!
Ya think?
Yes.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Yeah.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
You don't love me, is that it?
That's good.
-- who's married to --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Even when you were young?
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
Happy New Year.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
What is it?
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
I think that's what I'm saying.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
Right.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
He lost all the weight... there.
Can too.
No.
What?
Definitely.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
I love you, too.
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
No, I'm not. 
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
A sense of humor.
I want my money.
Yes.
Howard.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Yes, I did.
What?
Magic.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.
Shhhh --
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Fair enough.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
Window.
What is it?
I don't think I have to now.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Will she scratch up your back?
Go to sleep.
What was?
Is that what she used to sing?
Like do you believe in heaven?
Good.
Not now, Jonah --
Everyone at work heard you.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
What about camping?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
You're welcome to one.
Whose side are you on anyway?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Who? A scab?
An American.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Never... never... never!
I did forget. Luís told me.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Can be what?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
No.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
That's it?
You mind?
No, Why?
Who wouldn't?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Yeah.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
And you admire that?
I don't want to.
Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Sorry.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
I think on account of his nose.
Yes, Jimmy
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Bubba.
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
What's he holding?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
I was talking about Miles.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
You must be a hell a shot.
Not where I come from.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
I've been humming it.
I don't expect to live that long.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
The men said, nine.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
The Germans do.
I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
What about the company?
Fresh out.
Nope.
Yup, hell of a mission.
How about you take your position?
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Let's just find someplace.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I'll do my best.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
But we accomplish the mission.
That's a mystery to me.
Have it your way, Captain.
You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
See to it.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Get lost.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Okay, thanks.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
Going out as friends.
I'm gonna call her.
Hang in there, man.
Wait a minute.
Oh yeah!
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Goodnight.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You should be.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
You're going.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Honey, about what?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
This is me telling you about me.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Pardon me?
Eight.
Goodbye.
So it's an honor?
Watch out for that glass.
Twisted?
You know what?
Job?  Being a great date.
Okay, bye.
What did you say?
Well... just meet her.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Why didn't you tell me?
No, we don't have to say it.
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
Yeah, uh-huh.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
What do you want?
What?
Okay.
What?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
No, really.
She's very successful.
I know
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
I called her up.
Alright.  Key?
We're full on bonded.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Sir, the list is correct.
Oskar, please -
War.
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
In Breslau.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
You're not telling me something.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
That's great.
That's great, thanks.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
We're losing the war, aren't we.
Pistols?
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Something they can hold in their hands.
The war could end.
I think it's too late.
More.
You did so much.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
On national television.
I won't.
Where?
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Why aren't you there?
Not until you’re dead.
Home--where he lives.
I think it's out of your control.
No. This is a set up.
Good question. You took the bait.
Meaning?
Billy had alibis too.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Just in case...
I don't play games.
Yes, goddammit!
What?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
But...
You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Melinda McGraw?
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Please, call me Gale.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
To me Hollywood is about death.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Someone stole Sid's file?
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
And who is that?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
What's your favorite scary movie Gale?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
That's funny.
Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
Bitch.
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Are you saying she was-
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
GALE WATCHOUT!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Hello.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
No.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Go there.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Yeah...
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...
Hey, hey, it's just me.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Oh Sidney...
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Stop it!
To apologize.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
I don't think so.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
You getting scared?
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Sure...
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Afraid not.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
He's not a suspect, is he?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Mind if I join you?
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
Hold up a sec...
Shit.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
He's her boyfriend.
What were you doing out here?
How is she?
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
Yes, sir.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
We had a run in the mass murder section.
It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I can cry on cue.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Wanna another beer?
Yeah.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
The official term is "psychotic".
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Later.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I bet he's pissed.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
No way.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
I did. He's full of shit.
Give it to me.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
Announcing what?
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
Whoa, whoa... what?!
What about sports?
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
A switchblade.
Bear with me.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
Satisfy our curiosity?
Call an ambulance.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
No.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
How do you know all about this?
You can't go in there.
We have probable cause now.
Think about how we got here!
We had him.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Well... what the fuck, man?
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Kiss me on the lips.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Did the wife confess?
How should I know?
That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Keep talking.
Ain't yours yet.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
What's that?
Nine...  Ten!
Not likely.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I've seen her...and she's alive.
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Only if I'm dead!
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Do you have a better idea?
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
We should leave the past alone.
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Yes.
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Done.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Who is that?
That's me.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
It's a comedy.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
So what do we do?
Very well.
Who are you?
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
Ethel.
The daughter of his enemy.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Who is there?
Oh, not for the world!
Even your play.
Moonlight!
That's my line!
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I was the more deceived.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
But why me?
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Wait there.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
A theatre poet?
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
No.
Think about it.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
I don't hear this.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Just stop worrying.
How much did you pay?
Not eating like you used to, that's what.
I beg your pardon?
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.
Yeah?
About the mail --
I don't know.
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
And you like it?
Yes.
So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
Cameron?
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
You're right.
Open it.
All right. No problem.
Is that all?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
No.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
David?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
We were just sorting things out.
That's what I thought he said.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
Who said there were four?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
No one. I promise.
What?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
But they sneer, don't they?
You get the job done.
What happened to that guy?
That's what I thought.
What's it about?
Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
All right.
I'm a doctor.
No. But he needs treatment.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
I suppose so.
Chicken salad.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Who?
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Gee, that's very serious...
I'll be right back, baby, really.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't care.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
Your husband?
I don't know. Just a minute...
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Then it's not your problem.
I guess so.
God, I adore you.
Gee, this is great.
Am I what?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Right.
And you need money?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
I'm sure.
I'd cut it...
You don't seem very sure.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
I won't screw you up.
Yeah?
Well, did you or didn't you?
Don't, don't, don't...
What are you talking about?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
You were great.
-- we are?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
What with?
What're you talking about?
Here in the canyon.
Who?
What?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
Do you really mean that?
Why am I great?
What!
Egypt!
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
About what?
No, but I think they might.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
What do you wanna know for?
-- no, it'll help me, really --
How?
Does it make you happy?
-- yes.
George...
I know it, I know it.
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Godammit, George...
Now wait a minute...
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
I'm not anti-Establishment.
No thanks.
Lester, it just happened.

I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I'm coming over.
Sid.
You do?
Yes.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Who were you talking to?
That's not very logical, Lester.
You're still jealous.
Fine.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
That's right.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
-- No. No really.
I would say so, yes.
-- uhh-huhh...
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Johnny!
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Do you have children?
John...
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
You mean they ate each other up?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
I can't.  I have too much to do.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Danny!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Thank you.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
Yes, sir.
Who?
A nigger!
Grady... oh.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
All right, sir.
Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I guess we've been staying up too late.
Good.
How do you like it?
Why?
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Wendy...
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
Well, that sounds fine to me.
can of itself be a problem.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Where's Mom?
Will you?
Rats...
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Yeah... sure.
Was it a prescription?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Perhaps.
Really?
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
And you listen to that?
What you do?
What?
What?
Yes?
Thanks.  A lot.
Oh my! 
Not in years.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
You betcha.
It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
You know that song?
Wet behind the ears.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
Amateurs 2
You know?  About me?  About everything?
Five a.m.?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
What?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
We're nuns!
What?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
My what?
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
No.  No.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
That's not the point!  They need me!
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
You won't even tell us?
I'm telling you!
It didn't happen.
So, take it off.
Where is she?
Yes?
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Christy.
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
... Brom Bones...
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
You need to sleep.
You will stay at her side?
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Not for lack of trying.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
What kind of nuts?
Witches do not exist.  However...
I hear nothing.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
If you want.  But...
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
We have no choice.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
I didn't see none.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Well, what did you want?
You have any biscuits for sale?
Okay. You don't have to though.
Yeah.
Catch you later Freddy!
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I reckon I feel all right.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Yeah.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
Yeah.
No sir.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I've got a feelin' today.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
I reckon.
I ain't got no boy.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Naw.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
What's that you say?
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Why won't he talk to women?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Where will he go?
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
An invitation?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
What about for you?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
How'd you get started?
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Yeah, probably.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
And what's that supposed to mean?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No, bully for you.
And you're giving it to me?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Sure thing. See you later.
And why the hell would you give me money?
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
The refrigerator?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Jesus.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Baby? And what baby is that?
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Well, if you put it that way...
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Yeah, I can believe it.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I don't know. For helping me out.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I'm not going to do it.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Fries?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
You're right.  I better use two.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
No.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Well...
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
I can't speak for him.
You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
I suppose you want a tip?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
Yeah.  Why?
No we're not.
We're not?
Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Knock it off, will you?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Oh, he does!
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like right after the ceremony.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Honey - she called me honey.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Okay.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
You like it?
I always did.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Oh - here and there - and around.
- you got to be blonde -
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Why?
Who?
About that roadhouse -
Flower girl.
I don't care.
We won't breathe a word.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Would you mind terribly?
My fault.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- Inauguration balls -
- riding to hounds -
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
What theory?
Tonight?
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
You don't say!
I am?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Completely.
You're flattering me.
Complete washout.
That makes me feel just awful.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Let's make it an even million.
I knew you would.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure you’re okay?
I’m sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
Mom, please.
I’m a hooker.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
You’re funny.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
I do?
A weekend?
I think that’s disgusting.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Spontaneously combust?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Sure. You’ve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think you’re easy.
Meet Nick.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation’s most precious resource: your daughter.
You don't live around here, do you?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Uh huh...
That's where we came from first.
Sure--
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
It's cold, Daddy!
Hi to you, son...
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
David!
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Good night, Mama...
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Tired.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
But, Nathan--
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Will they give him a trial?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
I hate the environment.
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Oh.
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Oh.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
I don't know.
Huh?
What?
Papa mama simi.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Dude, what the hell is going on?
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Uhh... Bacon.
FREEZE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Okay...
Wow!
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Huh?
Right away, ma'am!
No, it was worse than that...
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Alright, I'll make the call...
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
You would know, dummy.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I am.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
I know.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
What's the matter, Wendy?
Wendy?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
And the butfor?
Oh, thank you.
Very professional of you.
They are awaiting further information.
The device has stopped responding.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Well shut it off at once!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Over and out!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Really?
I don't know.
So we did.
The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
No...
You too.
Sooner than later.
It would matter to us.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
So I've been told.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
A bowler.
I hate fuckin' opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
It's mine.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I'm getting to like it here.
You got a better offer?
He says that to all his wives.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Hello, mom?
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Who's there?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
You know who I am?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Why would you help me?
Look who's talking!
Bowling "Center"!
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yippy!
They suspended me.
Uh...over easy.
Business.
Whoa.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
What's plan B?
Plan C...  ...is me.
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
We would have sooner or later.
Tell me what happened Theo.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Back away then.
How about I just press the button?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
Yeah.  I heard you.
Fifty yards and closing.
Thirty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
It's either that or we grow gills.
Do you see it?
Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
-- and then brought her down here --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What am I -- a dog, now?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
She's not gonna know.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Sir, about leaving --
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
The timing has never seemed quite right.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Yeah, it was awful.
Yeah, why?
Eggs.
You went through Edmunds' things?
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
I have to reset the sub.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Are you?
Don't you?
C'mon -- what?
Is it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
"It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Top shelf, is it?
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
By the bunks.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
What?
Where's it coming from?
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
Gimme another explanation.
It's like...
What are you still doing here?
You don't understand about the sphere.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Shut up and open the door.
Hold on.
You got her?
Wait!
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
But it's impossible.
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Squint harder.
Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
Unless it's an act.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Who's going to pay me then?
Fear is their greatest weapon.
What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
Could I learn to feel it?
He can't find Organa Major.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Move out of the way!
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Well, whad'ya know...
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Why not ?
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
You two have so much in common.
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Hut... hut !
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
I wouldn't mind.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
The Rodger Young just burned up...
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
That is how V'ger will survive.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
May I ask Why?
I'm aware of that, sir.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
You asked my opinion, sir.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
The point... 
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
I'll be there.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
You bet your life.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Of course.
And likewise.
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...I always thought so...
Mmm.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...that.
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You'd know better'n me.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Me?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
"Room Service!"
Read the card.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You believe that?
Go you Huskies!
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
Going home.
I told them what you said about the script...
It does?
Oh yeah.
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
...you think that's right...
That's right...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Courthouse back in town.
Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
That's right.
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
Isn't he...
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Mr. Bailey.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
I...I...
The minute I read that script I said...
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I can't tell.
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
Well.
You said <u>three</u>...?
This young woman.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
A witness to what...?
"Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
Not now.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can only write on a manual.
No, what is it?
I don't know.
I don't...
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
I left that for you.
Did you bring Bob's weights?
...not at all...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
That will never happen.
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
She knows every neat junk food place.
I bet.
Mom?  What's wrong?
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Don't. Take me with you.
You lost Ben?!
I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
This is my daddy's house --
Hold lunch!
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Not use my words, please!
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
That's my girl...
There you are!
Don't take my picture!
You owe me a quarter.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Rache says it's from you.
But you can still see him.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Let's take our best shot.
You think I didn't get that?
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Easy enough.
You're WHERE?
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
We don't have any coffee.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Don't flatter yourself.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
How's she doing with Brad?
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Give 'em my number.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Aw.
That's not wh...
Double.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
We have to talk.
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Does Jackie know this?
You heard me: leave the table!
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Yes.
Four brothers and five sisters.
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
Why was he on Death Row?
No, you don't.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Nothing, I guess…
OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Your story was terrible!
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
The same.
OK!
Take off your top.
Ni...
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Anything I might know about?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
No, thanks.
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Oh.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
What happened!
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Well Cooper...
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
Like where--in your dreams?
I don't want any...
Good.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Good.
I say we head out.
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
There's enough in one vial...
Possibly some coffee?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say, sir?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
No, sir.
Plan-R????
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Yes, sir.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I see.
Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person -- 
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Peace on earth.
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Why can't you cancel it?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
How many planes did we lose?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
I don't think so.
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
First safety.
Master safety on.
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
I mean pulling a stunt like that.
I don't get you, King.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Roger.
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
But who would be chosen?
I don't know.
I don't anymore.
Can I have some?
In Group?
Intense.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Yes.
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Yup.
It's really not about anything.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
The dude wants it.
That's the rock star thing.
Sorry.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Sure.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
Wait. Hey, man.
Buff...
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Bullshit.
Guess not.
No.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
In what way?
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Well, play it, man.
Hey, thanks, man.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
Yeah.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
He is.
What about me? I don't have a car.
I'd like to.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Nobody. Sooze.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What?
Well, w-what happened?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
No.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Is that Bee-Bee?
I gave it to you.
Nazeer what?
No.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
So you can give me more shit?
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Yeah.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Mm-mm.
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Mm-hm.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Like songs?
Well, not exactly.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Please. Look...
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
It's stupid.
Yep.
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
It's none of my business?
What are you going to do? Hm?
If you hit me...
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
Come on, Jeff.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
She thinks you went to the police.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
I didn't mean to --
Come on.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I tell you this is half sold.
So long.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
I'll make it short.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
What has Artie to do with it.
You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
What happened?
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
They'll love it in Pomona.
This is fascinating.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
You can stay here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
Just a scene I cut out.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Come here!
Who?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Where are my cigarettes?
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
For me?  Okay.
You did, sir. GILLIS' VOICE He goes out.  Gillis     I pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
Is that so!
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
What doctor?
What?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
You say the cutest things.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Who?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
I have to.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Come on, let's ride.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
Why not ?
What's that?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
But what if---it wasn't real?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
What?
Well thanks a pile, fella.
A passionfruit smoothee.
I'll drink to that.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
I don't want your help.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Theories?
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Did anybody notice you?
You're supposed to guess.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I'm Linda Lee.
No, MR. Danvers.
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
A cheap trick.
I know.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Yes, mustn't stop.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What? What did you tell me?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Nope.  Never. 
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You thought that?
I mean him.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Old ties are hard to cut.
Can I help?
Well, aren't you excited?
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
We get together sometimes.
What are you doing?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
So where is all them half-centses?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
When?
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
They ain't got captains?
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
What do you want?
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
We back in Metropolis?
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
It was hot!
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Tell me.
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Blizzards! Heat waves!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Don't cry, Bubba.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Hostages?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Lois, I . . .
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I think he said a "curl."
Where?
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Shhhhhhh!
It will. Starting with your own.
Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
Yes, but will you honor it?
And I will lead.
Stay. I will come to you.
I really don't think . . .
Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
. . . And  very naïve!
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
You are . . .
What do you fear?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
We're running out of smoke.
I know.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
What the  --  !
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Of this...Superman.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
What are you doing here?
The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
So I've noticed.
First the pets, Otis.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
I know...
I didn't bring any  --
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Lex is going bye-bye.
But so is Vond-El
All of us.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
I came to talk to you.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It's not bad.
What about it?
Pink.
Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
Of time, Luthor.
Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
Maybe I should get help.
For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
How are you?
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
That's okay.
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
No you don't.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why?
It does concern me.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
When the game's over, I guess.
They can look forward to that.
Sure.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Berry-picking.
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
And winter?
Well, winter's far behind us now.
Did he say what about?
It's like a song.
Nicole?
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
The people in the town?
I'm absolutely positive.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Thanks.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Daddy?
Well, let's see what we get.
Please.
Yes.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
What time in the morning was this?
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Positive.
Why not?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
You remember this?
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Great.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Great.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Is "he" inside?
I doubt that it matters any more.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
No, I wouldn't...
Why, has he bothered you before?
Is it news to you?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
Who said Sidney?
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
When?
No, I won't...
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Don't go wild, Sidney.
Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
And where was his wife?
What kind of an act is this?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
But...
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
We stick in each others craw.
Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
What ship?
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
I made you write a beautiful song...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
Those lying motherfuckers!
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Why?
Smile?
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I love you, John.  I always have.
Correct.
Then what?
I have detailed files.
Please continue...
On all what?
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Some.
'Dim-shits'?
So what is it?
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Your manner.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Not yet.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Yes.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
I don't buy that.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
I wish to say something.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
Yes, that's what happened.
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Do it, Helmuth.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
You're late.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Can you handle it?
I won't let the fat kid down.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I hate the beige one.
Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
About what?
That's the way it was told to me.
You must have had a fun child-
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  Never.
It's better that way.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I can't sleep.
Okay.
I hate the weird ones.
I know.
Call her again.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Did you?  Kudos.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
I'm sorry, about this...
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
Hm?  Oh, yes.
I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
It's okay, dad.
I don't...
Wha... ?
Get out.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What... what do you mean?
... what... ?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Stop talking to them!
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No!
Claire.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
No.
Happy Birthday, man.
Which grad-school?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
You need anything?
Really?
You dodged a bullet.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Split it?
And, they didn't take that watch?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I'll call.  I really will.
I know.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
What kind of vacation?
We provide whatever's lacking.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
It's all down to this...
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Guess!
Don't take another step.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
I'm not sure.
His behavior... ?
No.
No.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
You know you can.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
What?
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
Maybe someday.
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Sure.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
It's okay... we're all here...
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
But the experiment was a failure.
So far.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I think so.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
As soon as you get dressed.
Who?
I sure hope so.
What did you tell them.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Terry Valentine.
Y'what?
This ain't your lot?
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Has he?
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
No one else is even here yet.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
That would be too easy.
Do you have any friends, man?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
It's been a while.
It was the bars, then.
How'd you manage that, then.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
Why not.
What do you think.
Tell us about it.
I can see the attraction.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
What about your grandmother?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
Fancy it?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Yeah, I guess you are.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Where is he now?
Ian?
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
There is?
What do you think?
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Go now.
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
Ah.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
Yes, Ann?
Hello, Birdy.
Ah yes, a music lover.
I don't understand.
Way out of line.
Yeah.
All right.
Uh-huh.
Mm.
Mm.
Who?
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
He and Doris... were having an affair.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
Sure you don't need one?
Yeah. What do I, uh...
No thanks, honey.
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Huh?
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
You don't got a headache?
Crane. Ed Crane.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
His eyes are open.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Why not?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
What's the combination?
Let's go!
Hurry up!
Oh Jesus...
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
What's left of it.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Got my hands full here.
It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
I know.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
I think so.
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
Read it out loud.
Yes.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Big as a house.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
How about lunch?
You have time to talk?
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
You loved him.
A monster?
All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
Where did you see it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
What?
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
It has to be the reality.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
--You never had a camera in my head.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Who?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I'm not hungry.
--we need more charcoal.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
Should I?
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Oh, just so.
When you get to Fiji?
--How do you know about that?
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
I'd ask for identification.
We don't even know you.
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
Penetration but not perforation.
When was that?
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Of what?
Is it an emergency?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Show you right on a map.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
You know my work?
It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
What killed those men?
What did it look like?
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
No you didn't.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
I just did. You're buying.
Something sweet.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
And where are they going with it?
Mulder --
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Maybe. Maybe not.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
General McAddie's.
I've got to find Scully.
He's come and gone.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
I do it all the time!
That's my girl.
No.  No.
What happened?
...give a kiss to Edward.
I know him.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
You think you can do this, don't you?
What difference does it make...?
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
I got it.
He's beautiful...
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
You're looking well.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Do you understand German?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Yes.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
How do you know?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
Ever seen one?
A bruised lip.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Take him to Sacher's.
This way, miss.
No, I don't know...
I know a very good dentist.
Who?
Never heard of him.
I told the police.
I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
Yes.
Must be some mistake.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Funny?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
His name?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Just five dollars, please.
Thanks.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
We moved rooms because of him.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Two.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
You want it to be an event.
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Then how come you're talking to me?
No.
What do you care?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Oh, yeah... 
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
It looks a little like a swastika.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
Did you see how they reacted to him?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
How would you kill him?
I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- 
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Female...
How do you reconcile the two?
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
So what Jew would you kill first?
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
I've got to get back to the --
<i>New York Times</i>...?
Here...
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Who even knew?
So what do we do with the device?
I have an idea....
Four. But no one this important.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What do you think you should have done?
Leary?
No.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
You're right.  You're fired.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
In a lake.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
No.
The Mamma's there too.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
That idiot!
Six seconds.
Then tell him to wax it too.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
... For the mermaids.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... I'm listening.
What is it?
Thank you, thank you very much!
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
You say that because you have the title!
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Thank you...
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I did?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Uh... Ah!  A story?
You are the father.
What?
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You called the police?
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
He isn't going to breathe.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
Yeah, no kidding.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Sure. Why not.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Why not?
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
And when you drink, you get drunk.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
You really think so, Charlie?
No. I'm serious about this.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Just barely possible - - yes.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
Get it out of here!
Now look what you've done.
What! You can't be --
Must it?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
That depends what you’re looking at.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Leon could still have hung himself.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Where is that?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
What do you suggest?
01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
How much of a hurry are you in?
I’ll call again.
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Is my money in there?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
What are you talking about?
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
Los Angeles?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Eh bien... T’es sûr que t’as besoin de moi?  La petite m’a l’air assez bien foutue, non?
Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
Are they still operative?
Costliest!
Majesty, I can't...
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, no...
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Tell the king to give me more men.
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But it is what I want.
We have to press home the attack!
Sound the retreat...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Guess.
The English??
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Praying.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
Buying her?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
I'm... I'm not the king...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
... as always, majesty...
Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
Noooo!
His face.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
He's on the other side of the river.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
God.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
The bridge won't wait!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
No...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
How many did he give you?
I -- I -- I...
I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I never lied!
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why would they?
Are you going to leave me too?
So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Jeanne, be patient.
It's nothing.
Really?
I'll see you...soon.
He'll be back before curfew.
Dead.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
wish I knew you better.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
We use what?
I can look after myself!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
Hungry.
Otherwise what?
I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
Toilets?
Why didn't you come to me?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
You made contact?
A pianist.
To be deaf?
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
The Alps.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
What happened?
It's my mother's piano.
Hello.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
We cleared 22 here.
They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Good lad.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
You never do, kid.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know anything about him?
No, not a thing.
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Did he hold you up on anything?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Five and call.
Pass.
The name is Lonnegan.
What are the odds on Syphon?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
Sixty-five.
You doin' anything tonight?
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
Give 'em a little time.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Don't think I know him.
I'll make parole.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Just a minute...
Don't cry.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Why don't you try him again?
There. 
Forgive me.  How are you?
This is my wedding.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Yes.
Yes... yes.
She could tell you where father is.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
He's holding out on you.
This is enough for me.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
He did!
No.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Goodbye.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Why, you said...
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I don't like him.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
I never had it.
That's just why I'm going.
I trust you.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
Slim.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Who is she?
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
Who's that?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
You dog!
I did find him!
Sure.
Got a nice evening dress?
The suspects!  They won't come.
It's the only way it makes sense.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Maybe we should split it up now.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
Let's go.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
I heard it.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're going to kill us!
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
Sure.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
I could use some recon photos too.
People are suffering.
Now you need me.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
You want to crawl, crawl.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Guess we know what the next stop is.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Eat your dinner.
When?
Now?
You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
Looks like dirt.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
They're watching us now.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
What?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
What have you done, Cut your hand?
No......  She's dead THX........
Where's LUH?
Save yourself....
Yes.
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Thanks.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Which one's which?
Your partner?
How do you know?
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
"Punks", huh?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
Stay here.
What? Nobody, I-
Shut up!  Who is this?
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Look who's talking, old man.
What?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I didn't. But I had to try.
It's our only option.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
Where did you find it?
Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
You're looking fine, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Doc--!
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
Very well, m'sieu.
Thank you, Major. 
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
What time is it?
Gaston Monescu.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
They're all right, aren't they?
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
I remember.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
What's wrong now?
Too much blue in crimson.
Yes.
You think that's too much?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
You're hired!
Correct!  Good night.
Adolph J. Giron.
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
Giron...!
Goodbye.
It could have been marvelous ...
Yes, Madame Colet?
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
To M'sieu Laval?
How much is your salary?
He started it.
Then why did you do it?
Well, he was in the navy.
Yes, my bag!
Well, where is it?
That's right.
An hour, two at most.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hurry, Rose.
I'm tryin' boss.
A hundred and one next month.
Don't you mean work me?
Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
...Mrs. Calvert?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
I felt like black.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Sure. Count me in.
Good. Settled then.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Excuse me.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
You're crazy.
Jack.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Sure. If you like.
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
Sssshh. Come here.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes sir.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
It's so unfair.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Sure!
Baloney!
Isn't that interesting?
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Where's Lother?
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
Fine--I'll be glad to.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Married?
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Don't let's talk about it.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
What do you know about them?
I thought you were a smart guy.
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Now you're talkin'!
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Sure.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Send that.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
That's fine.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
Very serious?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Good-night, folks.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
I went for four.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
You leave the kid alone.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Not a chance--I'm through. 
It all depends on what you're used to.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
That's not what I meant.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Beauty, ain't he?
Well now that's a little more Like it.
We're gonna get along just fine.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
No...
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
How you feelin', Doc?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Sorry...
Not half as bad as I feel.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Good God, you're really-
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
I laugh sometimes
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Yeah?
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Come on. I know better than that -
Gone fishing.
Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
They point, I shoot.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Have we met?
I'll keep that in mind.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
... Yes?
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
I am. What do you want?
What's wrong?
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Get more men up there!
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
Who is it?
Junior spends time with his child.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
You were in hell?
Babe Brother.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
Just stay in bed and rest.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Well, I don't want to put you out.
You should go back and rest.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
That's nice.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
What?  What is it?
Woody!  Buzz!
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
You mean that happy child?
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Then we've no time to lose!!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Woody!  The rocket!
We're not aiming for the truck!
I can't see a thing!
Miss.  G-6.
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
I don't know!
Oh no, Hannah!
Nothing.
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
No, Slink --
Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Ah, come on now!
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
So did I.
Nothing is left but us.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
What?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
That's frustrating.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
She asked me not to.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Not yet.
Will we get invited to the White House?
In school?
What's that mean?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Not Tiger Woods.
We're playing!
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
We aren't barbarians.
Not in...
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
This is a very different proposition.
I feel like a traitor.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
What kind of research?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Where are you going, Diane?
Right. You can't sleep here.
You're too young.
It's Iggy Pop.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What happened?
Eh? How's that?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Spud, they're my sheets.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Exactly.
Another dab?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
You can look it up.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
What's wrong, Allison?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Don't know. Maybe Thursday.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
But you don't have the money?
The Sick Boy method.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Stick it on my tab.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Pavel.
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Oh, please.
But how?
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
Why?
Mr. Sulu. Execute.
Captain, what have I done -
You ordered me to kill my brother.
I am here, Captain.
Uh-uh.
It must be all those marsh melons.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
I don't control minds. I free them.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Why not?
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
Sybok, we must find a way...
You invented Space Paranoids?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Okay, okay...
What -- ?
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Yeah...?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Then...
Not us, I hope.
It's too far!
Let's get some power here.
Why? What are you going to do?
Probably.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Alan-One...
We have to talk.
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Where's Flynn?
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Out.
Where are you off to young lady?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yeah, right.
What?
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
It can't be.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, but for who?							*
Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You're welcome.
Yes sir.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
I'd like that.
It's certainly... dramatic.
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
Okay.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
What'd you do, honey?
They said you had to run out.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Would you say he was boring, then?
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Yes.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
I'm married!
I don't know.  I have to think...
No.  He checked out okay--
How?
His wife.
He wants to speak with you.
How come?
Want some Goobers?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
That dazzling imagination.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Is this a joke?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
... was so romantic.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
If I thought I could get away with it -
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Let me handle this.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?
The police department?
They'll be along.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
What makes you think I could do that?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Sure.
Absolutely.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Not a tiny little vial -
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
How the fuck could he know?
No.
Yeah, I live here.
Well, you go down Beechwood...
I need to go.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
Hiding?
No more drugs.  Please...
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
See -- you can drive after all!
No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Maybe I do.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
You don't fear death?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
It will.
Out of here.
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Don't look like nothing.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Two-hundred.
I want my car.
May I carry your package, Grace?
No trouble at all, really.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
What do you do anyway?
Come here.
Such as?
Still playing?
You could just leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Whatever it takes.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
We're going all the way.  Together.
Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
Where are you going?
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
I'll get it.
The trunk.  It's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You meant it.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
What should I do?
You didn't kill her?
You know what I mean.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Jake--
Liar.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
Oz.
Christ, I don't believe this.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
Jesus!
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Sure, Sheriff.
That's 'cause he's dead.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
More or less.
It ain't broke.
Live there?
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No!
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
What are you talking about!
What?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Will you shut up!
He's up at the Look Out.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
You got the money?
Soda.  You know.
You're not from around here, are you?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Where'd you learn to do that?
The same thing you do.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
You know what I want.
Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Did you ever?
Is that why you're with him?
Nothing.
Try me.
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Is it pretty?
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
Kill him.
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I thought you couldn't get your car.
No! You get it!
I'm not coming back.
But I thought --
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Out of here.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
What kind?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I want my lawyer!
Oh.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
What things?
I'll help you.
No Jeremy.
I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
Was your family traveling with you?
On a bench, across the street.
I fined 'em instead.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Innocent of what?
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
He said...
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Nope.
Oh. How long I been here?
She back in Kansas?
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Alive?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Uh... Duke.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
She's passed on, Kid.
No.
Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Tell me right off if you see him.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Lemmee see it.
Yeah.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
I could tell you who was last, mister.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
This Kid, what's he like?
Sally?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Huh? Uh... yeah.
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Two more hogs got the fever.
The Kid, yeah...
Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
No... I meant...
He's blind, for Chri...
I ain't blind, you asshole.
Yeah.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
Maybe.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They'll never stop.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I don't know. This is bad.
They fucking know everything.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I'11 be alright.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Hungarian?
This I had to see myself.
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Who is he?
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
I want to see him.
Where?
What?
Keaton was a piece of shit.
You got him wrong.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Immunity.
You're joking.
Abrams...
I'm fine.
Nothing.
Four cases in three years ...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Well, many reasons, actually...
Well, we...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
I'm just an M.D.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
It's a crime.
I . . ..
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
It's a common medical term.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
... and you're going to do that?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I understand.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I had a witness disappear on me.
Defense...?
Listen to me, fella...
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Exception!
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Laura.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
What happened...?
No, no, I'm just...
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Who told you that?
Dr. Gruber's not in.
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
...one of the other nurses?
The broad has disappeared...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know.  I went ...
... You saw her?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Yes.
One hour.
Yes.
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
I married into it.
Someone dead.
No.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
There are things you didn't tell me.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
She is not my wife.
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
She... went into the Bay.
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
You.
Why?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Why?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No.
Please! And don't look at me.
Judy --
Yes.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
Is that the best you can do?
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
Take me away...
You can't. You're afraid!
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Do you remember where you were?
At...
Where had you been before?
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
My name is John Ferguson.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Some people prefer it.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
Why did you jump?
What else?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
All the time.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Tell me.
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
I love you too... too late... too late...
To the church, I must go there.
Madeleine!!
Yes... you run this hotel.
Please answer my question.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
What car?
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Why?
I know. Everybody tells me.
That's following a train of thought.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
What.
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Nothing to tell.
You haven't told me everything.
Out. I've got things to do.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What I've been doing?
Naturally.
Wandering.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
I didn't hear you.
Multiple reasons.
She's dead.
What are you fucking talking about?
What are you talking about?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
There's more.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
We can't do this.
So that's what we're doing.
I am not flexible on this.
Alright. Let's do it.
They're driving me nuts!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
I won't do it.
What happened? Oh my God...
What.
Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
Fish?
Shut up.
Nobody knows.
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
What did you ask me?
What?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Just do it.
What does that mean?
I don't know...
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
My what?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
The hell I did!
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
The rings?
Government cutbacks.
I think I forgot the tent.
Why?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Don't you dare.
He's weird.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Maybe.
Of course.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Okay. Okay.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Who's dead?
Like how?
The only proof is those bodies.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
It means she's insecure.
I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Buzzing?
The wahoo moment?
I got to agree with that.
I have no idea.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
Oh I know that. How does it go...
You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Okay boys, smile!
That's right.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
You see, even the voice.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
Whatever you like.
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
What's the matter?
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Good.
And in the vegetable plot?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Why not?
Where?
A black bull!
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
I had so many things to think about!
Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
I'm only good at making people laugh.
From the terrace.
No, I don't want to.
Me? What did I do?
But only you will know he's not human.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Only because I got pulled out early.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
How should I know?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
It was you, wasn't it?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
All my work is my finest.
Go to hell.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
That, or living through him...
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Why's that?
Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
No, this is great.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
And you?
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
...the... 
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
The Hostages...?
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
We'll be back tonight.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Due in Nashville.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
Y'wanna follow the Cattle Drive?  Sleep in the Winter. What does <u>Moss</u> want...?  Matchmaker comes to the Levinsky Family.  Mr. Levinsky, Mrs. Levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son Saul, from Princess Margaret of Great Britain.  Well, they think, she isn't Jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  Alright, yes, they say.  We would consider such an offer.  Wonderful, matchmaker says, My Job is Half Done.  Now, Look:  I got the <u>file</u>, from the L.A. contingent, I got the day-by-day, of how...
War's over, Pal. 
How's your wife?
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
No.  No.  He didn't mean anything by it at <u>all</u>...
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
Where's my pill...?
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
ON LIZ, AS SHE WALKS THROUGH THE H.Q., ON A BOARD WE SEE "DAYS TILL ELECTION 6" AND % IN FAVOR 82%.  A HUGE TV SHOWS THE PRESIDENT.
Whaddaya think?
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do people go to war?
I'll play your silly game.
...you the Press Office?
...Good...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Have him say, 'I know we're all concerned for the President, there will he an update at 5:45.'
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
W...what?
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
We'll deal with that when we come to it.  <u>This</u> is producing.  <u>This</u> is what they pay off on...come on, Pal, Boots and Saddles...
Watch me.
...what is this?
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Fine.  Good.
Well, there's a lot to be said for that.  And I'm going to show a clip.  You've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With the election one day off, and the President's standing in the polls...
A beret.
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Oh really.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
Alright. Why so pissed?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
I don't know anything!
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Excuse me sir.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.
You really do believe in destiny?
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
Why?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
He still likes you
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Thank you
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
No?
She went to a waxwork party
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Come on.
That's not what you said last night.
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
Your friend saw them.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Have you been hurt?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
She isn't here.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
I'm not...
I've never even met you.
Um...sure.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
...just so she could cut them off.
You are?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
It's niiice.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
I don't...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
M-E...
Jody, wait.
Something was there.  You saw it.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
I can't believe this is happening.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Shhh.
Mmm.
More or less.
That's not what I'm sug--
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
You know what that does to me.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
We're going to be fine.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
How did you--
What are you...?  No.
Sweetheart--
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Really big bed.
Yep.
We walked all night...
You told me that I was...
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
...I'm positive this time...
To Caitlin!!
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
It's alright.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
Huh.
Don't think so.
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Rowan.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
I had you sent away.
You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
FAST.
He just went out like & light-
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.

I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I LOVE him!
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
I'm glad you're around to say it.
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Really...?  Your family there...?
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
I don't think of us that way - ever.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Mm-hmm...
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
You really love this guy...?
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
BRIAN...
So there is only one key...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
You heard me - keep away from him
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Is LESLIE here?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
I think you had better leave
Yes - of course.
Yes...?
INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Yes - one please.
Were you always this sick?
I defy any and all limits.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
We reinvented ourselves.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
So that's a maybe?
Do it?
Which you pulled, hard!
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
The lesson being?
Of course we are.
Whatever helps you cope.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
It's okay. You need me?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
My legacy.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
In what sense?
I'm trying to help.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I mean my father.
It's incredibly simple.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
You're amazing.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
That's hard to believe.
Very ambitious. I like that.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
You called the cops on us?
Me? The King of Coitus?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
My job. Back off, Benedict.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Kelly.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
I know you do.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
You have someplace to be?
No.
I guess.
Where's this coming from?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
I wanna go home now.
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
You're out of your mind.
Police -- God -- get a life.
I'm not on your property!
So you got my mom's money.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
Okay.  I love you too.
Say you love me.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
There's nothing for them to get.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
That's right.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
We?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Jim West.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
I'll work on it.
Aha?
Prepare what?
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
Almost?
Yes.  Now, observe....
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Well... that, too.
Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
I adjusted it.
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
Of course not.
Really?
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
You bring the best out in a man.
And now the job's yours.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
In an hour they're gone!
Then come with us.
Yes...?
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
As above, so below.
I don't know.
Friend of yours?
Willow!
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Watch it!
Absolutely not.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
What do I need for that?
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Me!
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Why?
Surrender!!
Shut up.
Who is he?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Milking?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
...I want to say a thing.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Sure have, Sam.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
You couldn't wait until morning?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
I'm going this morning.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh. The bullets.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Where's my baggy pants?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
I'm coming.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Probably.
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
You shame yourself.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
No --
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
Not so fast!  Not....
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Goodbye, folks!
Oh!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Aw, come, come, come --
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no -- no!
Oil can....
Oh...
...Oh, did that hurt?
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh --
Oh --
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
No, but you tried to.
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
To Oz!
What?
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Dorothy next!
Now...
Not nohow!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Quiet!
No, sir!
Emerald City!
I don't think I could, but we could try.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Oh, dear, dear.
Oh --
You put up a great fight, Lion.
It makes you nervous?
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
Renard.
The worm on the hook again.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Consider me ungrateful.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
Really?
You, of course. I need some information.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
What’s your business with Elektra King?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
A rope!
And the payoff on the tables?
A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Marvellous.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Washington?
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
No.  I just wanted you to --
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
What if you¹re wrong??
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
Old?
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
What are you up to?
All right.  Mission accomplished.
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
I think he's going to the john.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Jon??  You mean he's --
What is that ungodly smell?
Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Yorgi asked me to.
Mind your business.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
That right? Why's that?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
You're joking, right?
I thought that was in detail.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Is this what you're looking for?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
He helped you?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
What was your grandfather's name?
Now wait a minute!
From your office, sir.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
What?
MMmmm.
You have your tickets?
Call me from New York before you leave??
Very....very!
I hope you like large weddings.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
What?
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Vermicelli.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
What?
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
Could be raining!
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
This guy means business.
But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Why?
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
It's the only way.
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Oh, just a little.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Inga, wake up!
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
Raise the platform, hurry!
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
Stop -- singing!!!
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Of course not.
Nor to Elizabeth.
Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?

Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
