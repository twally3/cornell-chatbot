Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Who?
Great
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Thirty-two.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
It's a lung cancer issue
What's the worst?
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Hey.
And why would I do that?
hey.  Great show, huh?
I told you
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Busy
Do what?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
So what did I have an effect on ?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
You up for it?
State trooper?
Fallacy.
No one else knows
Is that a request or a command?
No.
No what?
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
It wasn't like that.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
When I go?
Say it
What?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Touch of the flu.
Did I have anything to say about it?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
He's the devil's child...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
No...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Chief says -- how many?
Why do you wish to sail west?
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
What are you saying?
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
New worlds create new people.
May I speak freely?
Do they have such thoughts?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
And what do you think Mendez?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
...delusions and paranoia.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I let her take a shower.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Sorry...PD only.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You goin' to the escort service?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
My point exactly.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Keep them out of my way.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Give me the address!!
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes.
Is there a problem?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Credit?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I'm trying to tell you.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
What was that?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
How long they been livin' here?
What the hell happened?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
Okay. 
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Really.
That seems very unlikely.
How?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
CONTINUED
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Yes, very pleasant.
Are you quite sure?
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
That's true.
That's true
I want to drive awhile.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
You're gonna help us take him.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
No way to start a partnership.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
There.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Right, partner.
Where's the goddamn car?
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Yeah, I see her.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Hey, there she is...
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
You real down?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
You're impossible...
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
When?
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
How much?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Who are you?
She's an exception..
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Yeah?
At least, the cat comes back.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Finished what?
You get that off the screen?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Why?... Why would you need me?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
I want your best man on this!
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Anything harder?
What are you talking about?
What the fuck... !
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
What are you... ?
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Call me Tom.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Celebrity Films.
What?
Tell me what happened.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Where?  Show me where.
Do it.
I never killed anyone.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Of what sort?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I don't know, where are yours?
Specialty product.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
What's this?
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
I'm afraid I don't...
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
I told you I can't, not yet.
You've found missing persons before.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
No...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No, sir, he is not.
No, you may not.
What?
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
What's wrong?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
How long have you been awake?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
Enough of that crap.
I don't get it.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
There you go.  Love you.
How was the meeting?
Alice...
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
But how are we gonna --
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
What about down?
The frogmen?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Why do you say that?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
There's got to be an explanation!
What's the running time?
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Oh.
Hmm.
This way.
Yeah.
I'm fucking out of here.
I just think you used to be bad.
No.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
You mean Twombley?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
How you holding up, Wade?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Could be.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Forget it.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
You knew me as a kid.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Can --?
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
In the living room.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
Wade?
Huh?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Alice...
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Did we warn them off?
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Yes, Mr. President.
We've already been inspected.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Yes
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Four...
You'll do it?
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
You know what?
What?
I don't know why you stayed.
What's going on?
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What's the story?
It's got to be stopped!
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
You mean...
Are you afraid?
Simon.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
What?
You're sure?
He's carrying a bomb.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Don't try to stop me!
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
But if you'll just give me...
I love you, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Oh, I'd love to.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Roger.
Excuse me, Sister?
The cockpit? What is it?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
William Harcourt?
How the hell do you know that?
Back off, George.
Screw you.
Your mother mates out of season.
I'm going home.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Position?
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
I get the picture.
No.  There's no way!
Hear me out...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
So.
How do you feel?
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
...We're coming in.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Don't go!  Please.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Why won't you check out LV-426?
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What?
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Why not?
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
What's the matter with you?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Wolfi!
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
This is not his handwriting.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Sire.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
What? On one hearing only?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Why not?
Papa!
Good morning, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Not that I've seen.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Is he working?
Is he working?
Well?
Yes.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
How could I not?
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Really? Why?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
How fortunate.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
I have come to commission work from you.
A Mass for the dead.
This is only a vaudeville.
Do you mean that?
Shall I answer it?
Would you? Actually, you could.
What?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Yes.
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
How well are you trained in music?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
But not his body.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Ballet? What ballet?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I agree, Baron.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Can we come in?
Yes.
Yes.
What shall we do?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, Doctor.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I thought you were asleep.
How old are you?
Now what do you want to talk about?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
Yes?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Anything.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
The zoo?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
No.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Where am I?
You've never had bad dreams before?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
Yes.
David.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
What the hell was that all about?
Did you hear that?
Heathcliffe.
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm going completely crazy.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Where you been?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Much better this morning, thank you.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
The theatre?
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Well . . .
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
I don't know.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Oh, ten dollars—
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
They must have turned him down.
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
No. It wasn't earlier because...
So you were home last night?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
We got a problem here, brother?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
I swear --
How many of them did he kill?
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Not now.
She had a moustache.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Sorry.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
What are you saying?
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Which one, right or left?
Shakespeare.  He's European.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Web died fighting?
Mm-hmm.
You know him?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Bob's upset.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Oh yeah.
Yeah Jimmy?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Jesse, are you awake?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
And what's this right girl like?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I beg your pardon?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
You almost ended my career before it began.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
That's what I would have done.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Now let's have a drink.
Well, not exactly.
This time we'll make an exception.
Really?
How can that be?
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
So he's won.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Pull out.
It's a plain end. I think.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
Are you using minoxidil?
Listen, what about dinner?
Don't come back.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It's just not.
No, you...didn't?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
We are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Yes, Patrick?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
That's...that's too bad.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
No. I'm okay.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Understandable.  Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Hang...out?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Hmmm.
No.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Don.
Well, I could he wrong.
No hash browns?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He does? You're sure?
I'm not...
What am I gonna do?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
No, Owen.
Is it over?
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
What're you -- what?
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
You can't just walk in, either.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
That was -- different.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Gary, hi.
Gary, I --
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
What?
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You're compulsive.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
...Milo?
Do we post it on the Net?
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Does he know you know?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
She's a programmer?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Or sometimes not at all.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
We know all that, Exposition.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
We won, Austin.
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Yes?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
What's wrong with your hand?
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Sure.
Here, use mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why?
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Of course, luv.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Danger Powers, personal effects.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
What did you say?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Did you ever...
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Knight ...
Secret ...
... love ...
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
People, too.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
To find out who killed my husband.
You.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
1922. Why the kippers?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I thought we were on our way.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
That's what we were working on.
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
You don't trust me?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Aren't you coming?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
Where are you going?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Where's Mother?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
We want Mrs. Peel.
Anyone particular in mind?
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Both, actually.
Does Cole know about this?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
The best.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
No, Cole, I...
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
I'm going now, Cole.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I'll take some.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
That's it.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Really?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
Ed... you're kinky!
You've been having strange sex...!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Under the table!
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
How 'bout this?
Very.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Who?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
I don't know.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
You gotta let me finish --
In the Field Museum once.
Yeah? What about Laura --
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Brian.
I work for city hall.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What?
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Do you have to do that?
What?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Fireman shit?
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I treated you better.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Inspector.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
You took the chalice.
So what are you doing here?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I want 15 on the Mets.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Yes, Sister?
Keep trying.
Please.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
What do I do?
You might be right.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
What's that?
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
I would like to change your name.
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I've never been given a fair shot.
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
This has to be a big mistake.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
I didn't mean that, in life.
I love you too, Daddy.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
How did you know?
Your life will never be the same.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Is that good or bad?
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Yes, your name?
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Same thing Giuliani said.
What you did is dead wrong.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
He said that?
Where is he?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Finland.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
How did you get this gig?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
You sing and dance?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I heard ya lady is wild.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
I fell out of my bed last night.
Never read a book in my whole life.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Good morning.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
I have faced that problem before.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I feel the ribbon.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You killed him you fucking faggot --
West was one thing, but this --
You saw West's body.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
What business?
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Where have you been, Jay?
Right?
Oh, come on --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
You're lying --
I... I don't know...
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
Who killed Pike?
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
What I said before --
That's horseshit and you know it.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
He's in interrogation?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
What is that?
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
So what now?
For what?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
This isn't the time --
What if I don't want it?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
He said what?
Wrong answer --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Thank God...
This is totally unnecessary --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
What do you think?
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
How would you describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Helping people makes me happy.
It's okay, just leave it.
No, I understand.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Really.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I thought you weren't dying.
Son?
Daffodils?
I do.
Mmm, what?
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
How much time does he have left?
Would you say you understand Josephine?
No I don't.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Do you like it?
What?
Ch...
Right.
Yes. I know.
Good. 
We better watch him. He's crazy.
What was that?
What was that?
Put the fucking kettle down.
What did he say? Tell me!
Just leave her alone.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Syevodnya
So what are you going to do?
What? No you're not..
Have you got your passport?
What?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
So now you hate all women?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You...
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
No. I think I better just go.
Whatever.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Angela?
You take her to a doctor?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
No, ma'am.
Holy shit.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
The fuck you laughin' at?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Better?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
LAZ, I said let...!
The fuck you been doin' to me?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Itches.
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What I love.
Why you say that?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
He tapped that.
Naw!
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Why's his britches round his knees?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I skipped lunch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I feel better. Do you?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I didn't know.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Squid?
What'd she say?
You'll take care of that.
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
What's he saying?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Big enough.
You did great, Ichiro.
He drinks.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
Save it, I already took the tour.
This is my stop.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Where are you going, Sebastian?
Just thought I'd...
I think, therefore I am.
You got a machine on it yet?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Yeah.
Day after tomorrow.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Number three.
Vodka!
Sorry.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Too old.
My job is here.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
I told you I'd come back.
What do people do in the afternoon?
What?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
What?
What?
Of course.
But I understand what you mean.
How come you were in my truck?
Where are your folks?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
You like it?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
What's wrong with you?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Perry?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Doing what?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Name it.
They're all divorced?
When do you need her by?
Is this your house?
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Yes!
Where's he gone?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm really sorry!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Yes, it is.
What?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Russia.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
No.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
Bye, Troy!
Thirty-five.
Help you?
Say what?!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Are you in trouble, son?!
What?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
No.  They all do.
Home sweet home!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
If I...you know...
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Let's eat our cake.
Yes.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Stop it, you two!
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
I don't know. I like to think so.
Then what?
Where?!
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Yes.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
You're all through with this now?
Jeffrey.
Don?
Do you like the way I feel?
No.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you love me?
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
He's comin' back? What for?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Do you want the car?
God, you scared me.
Yeah, I know.
No.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
How ya doin' Dad?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I don't know.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Are you alright?
Yes. I do.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
He got a little jealous.
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Look Jeffrey.
What?
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
What happened?
Yeah, well...
Hello.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
Absolutely not.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
It was... It was...
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Hello?
Roc. You okay?
Liberating isn't it?
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
You bet your ass he will.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Yeah, I heard that.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Dignan, calm down.
Is that the manager?
What do you think?
Because my mom gets the bill.
I don't want to use it.
May I have a word with you, please?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Which one was that?
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
Obviously. That's a given.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
I wish I'd been there.
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
We've got sixteen dollars.
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
OK. Mark that down.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Do you like Inez?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Help me move him.
Come on.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
No. I'm not.
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
That was a test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
Bob, where you going?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
It's in the driveway.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
What?
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
That never would of --
It's true, Dignan.
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I warned you, Dignan.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
How much is there?
You can go first, Bob.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Not in that car you're not.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
You don't even know his name.
I couldn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Wait a second --
You keeping out of trouble?
Why?
Where?
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
You Hoto?
Mr. Henry?
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
That's not gonna fly.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Don't you want answers?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
'Why' would be enough for me.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
What do you have, Danny?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I can't let you do that either.
Front. Use your teeth.
Try again.
Who sent you to Greece?
Conklin up front.
No. There's nothing new.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Switch! You drive!
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- it's just him? --
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Who?
Looks like he's been detained.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Mr. Nevins?
What kind of problems?
Good luck.
So he fooled you.
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
He was a modest man.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Who would do such a thing?
And the bad news?
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Just. Like. Jason.
Straight up.
What did you see? What did it look like?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Huh?
Ouch.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
It was a long time ago.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Oh? There's proof now?
I just thought you should know.
Know what?
I don't get it.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
It didn't feel like a dream.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
What?
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
How long have you been married?
Oh, yes, please.
I see.
I'd better be going.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Rick?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
And the other alternative?
No.
Yes?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
You can believe that if you want to.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
No, not yet.
Where is Rick?
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.
How do you do?
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
May we proceed with the business?
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
But I have no excuse to close it.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Okay.
Yeah, you were saying?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, it's my party.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Put that phone down!
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
For how long?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Feels so good to lie here.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Take it, damn it.
Get water!
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
They're on autopilot.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Had a package to deliver.
He is a cute thing.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
Come on.  Try.
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
I was making a point.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Cool ropes.
To life.
Thanks.  For everything.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
They just want you to hire some new help.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
You cook very well!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
At least you were never lonely.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
I know, I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I just wanted to ask you...
Is *your* father dead?
*Liver* killed him?
I don't remember.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
There was no visible wound?
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
Where's the name sheet?
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Uh... sure.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Who cares?
When will he be home, Major?
*What* view?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
The Anti-Christ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
So how'd you get caught?
But there were other factors.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
Ten is standard, sir.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
She up for this?
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
What about... The money?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
What about Customs?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
He's gone.
Lighten up.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
How do you know I will?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Yeah.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Uh...
What?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Escorts!
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Ten percent.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
To who?
I hate cheats.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
Where did you get it?
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Marion, stop this.
Why not?
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
Found a job?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
What happened?
I'm in trouble.
I know that. But you can now.
They mean it.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Let it go.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Where's the magnet?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
How do you feel, Jack?
What flickering light?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Oh, God...
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Hey, bomb.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Exactly.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
-- automatic channels open --
TALBY!
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Commander? Are you still there?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
What?
How come I never hearda you before?
You mean until you showed up?
Why would I be pissed?
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
A grand.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I don't get involved with guns.
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Whoever that is.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
It was open.
You got a lotta nerve.
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
That would be appropriate, yes.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
How well do you remember the lab?
How much do you know?
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Your help.
You don't want to.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
This is not a place you wanna go.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
A long time.
They're prisoners to their genes.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Make the call.
Right, the big one-oh.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Whoa... she is a killer.
You got in the car, didn't you?
Yeah.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
They're what?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Ahh, sunshine.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Simplicity, Hawk.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Two hundred bucks?
Beg pardon?
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
How can you do that?
Where did you come from?
I am so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
That was a compliment.
Where are we going?
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Will you please talk to me?
Where is she?
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Grandma Death.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Cellar door.
I think he saved my life.
Do you think a lot about girls?
What else do you think about during school?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Nothing.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
People get hurt.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
How did you know --
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
What is this shit?
Where is she?!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Loretta, don't do that.
Oh, Amber...
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
What're you doin' here?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Are we on "Cops" again?
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
That's enough!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear President"...
"My dear President"...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Yes, sir. 
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Are you getting tired?
You swine!
Give me that again!
No... it was a seven letter word.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
You stay with me.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He fell.  He falls.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Good! How is the patient?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Romance!
Have you read it?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
John Merrick.
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness for his namesake.
How is your tea, John?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Fine.
The workhouse.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
A dressing bag?
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
It was different...
No!
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Would you like us to sing to you?
But you don't want to hear it.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Oh, get it over with.
What?
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Scream.
Aaagh! Rape!
What a stupid idea.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
What?
You talking piffle, son?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
But you're the Gods!
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Wait, Erik!
What are you talking about, Erik?
Do what?
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Are you all right?
Aaagh!
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Sh! Hurry!
Relax!
Shut up!
There is nothing we can do...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well... I'm game.
Yes, Mother.
No, Mother.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
And I just liked you so much.
What's wrong with me?
Really? Because --
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I don't really know how --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I don't know what that means.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Probably see you at the book store.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
You know Wilmont?
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Take care.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
You like that?
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Ready for another?
You just say. I'm not really --
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Yeah.
Yo ho ho!
You're not ready.
I want to know you.
Joely...
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Egad, were you horrified?
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Hi, it's Joel.
I don't know. Panties and --
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
What?
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I hope you get your work done.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
See you later, alligator.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Hey.
I swear.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
How do you mean?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
So, I've got to drop the van off.
You're political, then?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I can see why they sent you along.
Justin?
We have a man down...
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What...?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Do you hear it? Right there.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
What happened?
What's happening...?
What's on your mind?
Justin, finish your sweep.
...I don't want to die...!
This is Weir.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
I can see the hatch.
Alive?
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Any survivors?
No one?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
I'm not the Devil.
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Yes, sir.
But...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It tastes bad.
Maybe one of the original crew?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Blow it up?
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Keep him talking.
Almost got it.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
Get them back --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
How?
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
What are you doing?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Five times.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Are you alright?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
What's wrong with me?
Hey! That's a prototype!
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
How's the IPO?
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Which was?
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Something happened to them, mon.
This is how I dress all the time.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Why can't you do it?
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone!
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Pick a suit.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Yeah?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Did you go home and get it?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Who's that?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
That's him! He did it!
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What's the big deal?
You'll always remember your first time.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
How long does Doug take?
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Can I come in?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
What's that?
How about the point?
Are you really nineteen?
What about those other guys you live with?
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you want to come inside?
Do you really have to go?
Hi, Mark.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Killed?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
What?
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
That's good...
Why?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
What limes?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus.
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Extract of pineal!
The airport is over there!
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
We'll meet in three hours?
Oh!
You got something better?
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Your brother, huh?
Um-hmmm.
He's dead.
He only shot you once.
What?
Four door?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Fine, Chief.
What?
Move slow and move quiet.
Shit!
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Get to your cars!
I'm fine, I really am.
Well...
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances?  Oh no.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Who?
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
Really?
No.
Thanks, Dad.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
...So what do you think?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Please, Francie...
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Fifteen.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
How'd I look?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I know what ability you're interested in.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Whattaya think you're in now?
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
You give up on her?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Where you goin'?
I don't care.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Well, who have we here...?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
I'll be back.
Don't... talk crazy.
You're not going anywhere!
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
It ain't for lack of trying.
I see.
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
And he drove me to mine.
What kindness?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Your crime... as well as mine.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
There is something I want.  A friend.
I will not! Kill me now!
She's not for you.
Must've been a terrible row.
Nothing. Still nothing.
So have I
And you?
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
You make me weak.
Victor. I love you,
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I thought I'd never see you again!
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Brother and sister no more.
Professor?
Henry Clerval.
Can you think of a better reason?
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Tomorrow is another day.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
What's the matter with it?
I wouldn't know.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Ned!
It's just a dream.
Are you wet?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
What are you gonna do?
What's your name?
Yes, she is.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
Why are you so agitated?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
I promise.
It's a flop house.
About two hours from now.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Not good enough, swear to God.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
-- you got your sink --
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
What'd ya see?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
This isn't gonna work.
This ain't the time, Richard.
I did?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Thank you, ensign.
Don't say my name.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
Really, I have no problem with --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
I'm not sure what --
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Did you hear?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, ma'am.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
O'Neil?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Which is guy-speak for...
You really came back for more?  Of this?
At first.
Last time I didn't.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
I can't go out.  Not like this.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Just askin'
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
I think you're the liar.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
This ain't workin' right!
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Women.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Yeah. Why are you asking?
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Most people don't.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
Circuits are overloaded.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What sample?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Is that the bathroom?
Don't speak, Quellek.
God, what an ass.
About this much.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
Shut up.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
What's  your name, son?
Okay, we got it.
What do you mean?
Lt. Madison, GO.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
It's suicide.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
We're doing episode 31?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Because it was on the show!
Closer?  I can try.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Mathesar? What is that?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Well, George, who were you?
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
What?  What are you talking about?
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
What are we going to do?
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
To hell with Arnold...
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
Colonel Reed...
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
You must be very rich.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
I'm very aware of that.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
Well, this must be about something!
You know very well who it is that I love.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
Juba was a Numidian.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I have to ask you for that key.
Not too bad.
Where is my nephew?
He's around someplace.
There's Ilona.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
Who?
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
The airport.
Hello? You there?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
I don't like waiting.
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Have we met? I don't recall.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
You pack a gun?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
What?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Twenty seven hundred.
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Wait. How about this?
That's not bad.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Right. See how your story ends.
Sounds fair.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
That's what the guy said.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Maybe that is his boat.
Smokes?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
How long to fix?
But how long?
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Dodge to Murphy.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Conveniently enough for you.
Morning everybody.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
What?
Go on.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Showing you what?
You killed them.
So you killed them?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Let the buyer beware.
I must be in the wrong business.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Say what?
Shut up.
What's this?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Give up?
What is it now?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Who is this, Enid?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
I might actually get the pasta special.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
That was truly pathetic.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I didn't get it either.
How about this?
It's a surprise.
Where did you get that?
Where?
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Hello?
What are you talking about? Who?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
There.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
How much is this?
Didn't they tell you?
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Fine, and how are you?
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
Wow!
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
PLEASE? We have to!
Yes, that would certainly do...
Jesus...
It's not hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Uh... hello?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
Does that mean you don't like me?
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
What?
What do you want?
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Don't they, though?
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
We have hunted since childhood.
Don't much like them.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
We need to talk.
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Have you ever failed?
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Oh yes, I think so. 
You've known him long?
Four should do it.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Does he ever mention me?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I don't know what to do anymore.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Is this the spot?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Who are you going to call?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
I await the word of Vigo.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
Egon!
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Is the line sinking?
Who?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Like a goat on garbage.
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
No.  They're just coming to me.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Are you all right?
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it.  Get out.
Out!
I'll scream.
Really!  Is it gone?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I don't believe in luck.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Does she want to be?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
It's working!
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Ray -- Something's here.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Do you believe in God?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
I am their hero!
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Then you'd be out of a job.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
I'm serious.
Give away food?
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
I was summoned.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Quintus is overly idealistic.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Do you always drive like this?
But, Elaine --
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
Yes.
Okay.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Why aren't you ready?
What is it?
What?
I'm meeting someone.
Elaine -- I love you.
Don't you have it on?
Are you going home?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
We just can.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Benjamin?
657-2036
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
You a student?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
What?
No.
Will you take me home?
What?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
Why not?
When is he coming back?
What do you think of me?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Sit down.
Yes.
I want to say something first.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want me to get it?
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Either one will be fine.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That you're afraid --
Well what do you want to talk about?
Don't you?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What do you say to him?
Well how long has this been going on.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
At college.
What was your major?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
Why not?
Then let's hear them.
No.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now don't start this.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But if it's sickening for you --
You don't have to say that.
Thank you.
This is absurd.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Sir?
Braddock -- Braddock?
When I go off?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I do.
When did you two talk this over?
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
You got me.
What?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
I don't believe it.
I want to speak --
Not now.
Well?
The pearls are in her room.
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
Who?
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Free --
Of course.
Chasing what?
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
What do you want here?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
How tired you are!
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Why do you smile?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
And now?
You do believe that I really love you?
Very early in the morning.
Bless you...
Yes -- I will be on the train.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
What?
You've lost everything?
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Be quiet.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
I don't know.
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
This gentleman can have my room.
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
No - absinthe.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Money!
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Oh yes, of course.
I'm the stenographer.
Tired?
Movies?
I understand you perfectly.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Well -- you want me?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Oh, yes.
Why not?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Shall I tell them again?
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Madam should sleep.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Why not?
Again?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
How is the house?
Four minutes past. Please come.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Bobo, no, I --
Your what?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
I certainly hope not.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
What? He's going to be all right!
But they must be! They cut glass!
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
I like those.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Not as tough as you, huh?
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Never.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Scram. Go home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You already went back to work.
What?
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
That's what I say.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
What?
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
I can see that.  Why?
Then you come out here.
Better?
Looks great.  It does.
It's John, isn't it?
Who?
Yeah.
Wait.
Ooooh, busted.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Answer what?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mommy!!!
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Where are you going?
What now?!
Come on!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Jamie's baby ...
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
I dunno, boy.
A bitch.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
You ever own a motorcycle?
Excuse me.
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
What's this?
You never played a violin.
Okay.  Okay.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I forget mine for years on end.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
What?
You invited me.
Out!  Out!
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Where's Mom?
They were in the same creative writing class.
It makes life spicy.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
You're supposed to get hurt!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
No, no, no, no, no.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Dad--
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Who was it?
It's your house, Dad.
"Hamburger Heaven."
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Now--turn around, if you would.
I have a brain.
I have some change!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
No.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
What are you going to do?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
He cried.
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
How do I load?
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You've been bitten by bats?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I was going to ask.
Are you've seen it work cures?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Poison.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
No!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Leave the rifle here.
You didn't even find that out?
Jesus.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
A lot of people don't.
Yes, he is.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What?
I don't get it.
Yeah.
Please--
Doing what?
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
Coming.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
What's the matter now?
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You're saying no.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
We made the date three months ago.
The what?
Meaning?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
You've got to fight from time to time.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
He died of a massive rupture.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Yeah.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You know her?
Something like that. How much do you make?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
But it's all you do.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
But what?
What makes you so sure?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Well, what do they know?
In G.R.? Why?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
No.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Wes, do me a favor.
What plan?
That's not true, Mr...?
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Rucker.
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
Huh?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
No.
Oh, I don't have one.
Lady, let me get this straight.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Officer, I can explain.
Where are the papers?
Wait here.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Eh, no.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Look.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
That wasn't very scary.
You sure have a way with people.
I don't know. Perhaps.
You should have been a poet.
I took them out.
Supper for two.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Just give me a rough estimate.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
And a lot of time.
Harold?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
Yes, sir.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Julia.
You knew?
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
No bad dreams.
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Steve...
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Who wards off demons.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Who's the squirt?
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Sir, may I go first??
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Don't move. We --
No. Don't --
Yup.
Myers?
Yes?
Anything else you --
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Cocky.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
What's happening?
We're leaving.
Alright, let's give it another try.
That your daughter?
The box... you opened it. We came.
You did this before, right?
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
I have to speak to my father.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
Come to Daddy.
But you said --
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Well?
What?
Hell...
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
She'll tell them everything...
Don't you care?
Not exactly modern.
No. I'm not.
I'll be down in a minute
What's wrong with you?
I... suppose so, yes.
Oh Christ.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
YOU'D like my room.
Take care, Dad.
Big house.
You like?
Is Julia here?
Kirsty.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
What's the problem?
We're on the Cointreau.
Meaning what?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no.
Are you alright ?
Your father told me you were working here.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What did I say?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Say it.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Ehh.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Suck my ass.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
What the fuck is that?
So?  You even said they're good.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
Holy Shiite!  What the fuck's this?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
He's got one!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Hey, Barry.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
What is this.
Shit!
So you weren't interested in music at all?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
It sounds stupid.
Is what better?  Better than what?
We'll talk some other time.
I guess.
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
Is that the last of it?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
That bad, eh?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Laura...
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Harder.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Are you persuadable?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough of what?
Are you okay?
Yes.  You?
I'm sure it isn't.
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Hi, Mom.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Sixty.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Records are those big round black things, right?
Nice.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Yeah.
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
Would you remember his name?
Someone beat you.
Grave robbers?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
You have an active imagination.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No one knows you're here?
Is this what you killed them with?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
I haven't killed _you_.
Come here, Brenna.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
I want Taupin.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I don't believe him.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Afternoon.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
You feel you know me.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
How can I stop such a man?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
Of course.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
But I did live.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Who am I deceiving?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Head still secure to the neck.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
I knew his great-grandfather.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tradition.
It's all we have.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
My condolences.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
We were very close.
No.
What's the idea of locking this?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Hildy!
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Hello, Hildy!
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
No, I can't.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Bermuda.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Afraid? I should say not!
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
We're not interested.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
All the words you've got.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Don't open that!
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
What!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
You grey-haired old Judas!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
I'm busy, Duffy.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
We'll fix that, too. 
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
You know it is!
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Don't forget about production for use.
How'd you get here, Earl?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Is it hard?
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What about it?
You need trees for an avenue.
It looks....foreign.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
He could always make me laugh.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
You're having me on, Molly.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Thank you.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Go around him.
What are you doing!
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Hmmmmm.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Fuck your grandmother.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
That's nice.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Jesus Christ.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Keys.
Just back up.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I suggest you kids leave now.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Well hello, officer.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
What about the body you found?
Hulk was dumb as shit.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui.
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Shall we close up, then?
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Well, I think...
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
You still in the market for a real boy?
What do you mean?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I'll be in touch.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
What?
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Good. Making progress.
It would just be helpful to know.
Do you like my new look?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
How come?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Yes.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
I'm ready.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
All I want's the money.
Could be.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Hey, mister.
Okay?
Yeah? Why?
Poker's not your game.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Hey, Findley's here.
How do we stand?
They're fine.
You want me to tell her for you?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
The expensive kind.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Well... well, now.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Glad to meet you.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
I thought we came here to play pool.
Yeah, sure has.
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
You quittin' too?
Couple of bucks.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
No.
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Mm hmm.
I've got something in my bag.
Do you want me to go?
What are you writing?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
He's a gambler.
Well, what else does?
Does it bother you? What he said?
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
No, I want to walk.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Go on back to the hotel.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Game's over, Eddie.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
How much do you remember?
Yes.
What?
What's inside?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
You and that damned garden.
Need some gas?
If we want it, it is.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
But it's not, Jimmy.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
George, where have you been?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Oh?
Why, yes.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
Is my wife in the air?
And our forces?
Really? You don't mind?
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stop it.
They let you out?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Why did you people come here?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
How's the head?
Alexandretta. Now we know.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
I said go around!
Uh-huh.
What are you going to do?
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Out!
Don't call me that, please.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
There were rats, Dad.
Will you take it easy!
No! Don't Shoot!
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Get that camel out of the way!
And why were you trying to kill me?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
That was a misunderstanding.
What's that?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
I like the service here.
A what...?
What?!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
What about the future?
Don't catch cold.
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
I want to go home...
Yes.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Who was it?
Who?
Yes.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Me? What'd I do?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No.
What are you doing?
Kill myself.
Now what?
Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
What am I supposed to do?
You mean...just leave.
I can't do that.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
I don't want to eat it.
What?
It worked.
I made it work.
Much too blue.
Not that tie with that coat.
She's the toughest to read.
Not her. You!
What is it?
What Happened?
Bingo.
You found her.
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Just stay here and rest.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
haka xuki.
While he makes the run.
And Dieter?
Be quiet.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Sorry...
What part what?
They have stolen state property.
Who's our little man?
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
That crazy guy?
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Well...
Oh.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Who?
Was quite excited, when he came in...
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Now you know what I know.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
You again.
Can I help?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
Last night?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You know where he went?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Hiroshima.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
I know the territory.
Are you alright?
Now what?
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
It's alright.
Just one. The back up.
This the only spare?
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
I'll take some.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Sure. Where?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Sure.
Do you want more rice?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
How are you, Jim?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Is there any more rice...?
I'm doing an interview.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes"?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
...you fucked me!
Oh, my God.
That's right...
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Alright?
Hardly new news.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
So, is everything okay?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
How have you liked your stay?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Far as you go where?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
How much would I get paid?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Excuse me. Yeah...
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
You mean... since this morning?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
There is -- there is no family.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
So she's uh, flourishing?
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
You're in a rush.
What the hell is Botox?
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So who'd you hire?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
He'll regret this.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Marylin! Listen to me.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Me. Yes.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I have a surprise for you.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Meaning my house.
Marylin?
Please! Leave the house.
Do you need a Tagamet?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Do you know him?
Well what does he want?
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Video.
What's Kirshner?
And she has...?
HA!
What...?
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Oh—Mary—
How is she?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
I might.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
I knocked several times.
On the road.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
You talk as if—
We've done that already.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Huh?
Oh, yeah?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
I don't want it reported!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
I never thought of that.
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Are you talking to me!
Your ego is colossal.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Like this. I have no robe.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman—a trip like this.
Yeah.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What's got into you?
Sure.
Raw?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
You're an expert, I suppose.
Clever.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
You bet I did.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Where's the bus to New York?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Yes—if he is your husband.
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
What time is it?
Collect?
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Well, I'll be—
When you sober up—come in and see me.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Mush. Mush.
Who?
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Yeah—wouldn't it?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Dad, look what I drew.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
No.  Never heard of him.
Who?
David Ferrie.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Allen Dulles?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
More than ten years.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
Yes.
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Fine.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
You gain weight?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
How many trips did you make?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you get it out?
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
My ass ain't the same.
I walked right past you.
What're you, a bag lady?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Why?
It'll be more than that.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
What do you tell Nicolet?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.
I didn't use you, Max.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
He say we like the same thing as married.
He say is a surprise.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
What for?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I understand woman, damn!
I got a problem...
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Drink?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Designer clothes.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Where at?
Uh-huh.
The roller disco one.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
With Ordell?
Must of made quite an impression.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
What are you doin'?
I'm carrying it.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Guess where I am?
The moon -- I dunno
C'mon in.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Louis?
You said five hundred and fifty!
How long was she in there?
We went to the parking lot.
What'd you shoot her with?
Tell me.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
You have cash. What do you need me for?
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
That's all?
How'd you find me?
Uh-huh.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Yes.
Give me his home number.
Get me out of here.
Where do you want to go?
Then what are you doing here?
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Remember?
Della?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.
Daddy!
Oh God!
Listen, I just got a strange call from Geary. He said the guys backed down. What's he talking about?
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Well, try, huh.
There was a bang.
I am.
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
What did she have to say?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She was good in bed, though.
Who did?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
No. The little one.
Yeah, but for what?
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
You okay?
Where?
What does it say?
I can't do it.
Don't gimme that.
Help me! Help me!
Am I home?
How come? The army?
Who else were you expecting?
Stay away from me, Jez.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Where have they gone?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
Jake, what is it?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Oh God!
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
The Ladder?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Dream on!
Where am I?
Speaking.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
You come home with me.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Bring it in.
You got lucky.
Goodbye old friend.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Better let me.
Hey! I'm not ready.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Wait a minute...I need...
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
Jesus, God!
We're screwed!
That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
See? We're not so bad.
I think I had some when I was eight.
Yuck.
Go-go-go-go-go!!!!
I'm gonna spew.
Hurry! She's lost it!
You're so bossy.
You're quicker than usual.
Kay-em 14.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Who are you apologizing to?
Leave him behind!
Something's wrong.
It's okay, he just wanted his machete.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
Did you get him in the head?
Probably out in the back yard.
Love ya.
Colorful, isn't he?
What'll I tell the kids?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
She's right.
He lost it on the way up.
What do we do?
Wait a minute! I need you.
Think the tide's with us?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
You from around here?
Some friends and me took a house.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
One more after this, then I'm going home.
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
What's that supposed to prove?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here...  ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas.
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Wait, let me take that.
Yeah. That was me.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
I try really hard, actually...
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Yup.
I don't really know anything about it.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Blood and guts.
What do you play?
When was this, like '96?
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Yeah.
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
That suits you.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What?
No.
What's the matter?
But you're old!
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Juno? What's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
What?
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Yeah, like people in love.
What?!
I am a suicide risk.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
No way! She's pretty.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
So. What's that thing?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
Hm.
Looks like it, yeah.
A hotel?
...Pardon?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You took this picture?
Happy birthday Adele.
Where you from Walter?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
A book on the warehouse murders?
I like that.
I still think we should have met them first.
There's more...
Yes!
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
What?
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
What for? That guys a dick.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Darcy?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Why not? You stink.
Casper! Was up kid?
Nothen' B.
Where you at?
What?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Who are they?
No...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Come dance.
I'm sorry.
You're OK?
Yeah, I guess so.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
You still mad at him?
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I'm coming.
Yeah?
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yep.
I hate 'em.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Mom.
What are you guys doing?
You want a wip-it?
Slow.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Local?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
How is she?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
What is it?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Why not?
But you said you didn't know her.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
What's this?
Now what?
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Congratulations, dad.
What are you doing up?
What is it, dad?
Well?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Anything else?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Answer the question.
Did you send the car?
You're always in the middle of a match.
Just thought you might want to talk.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Sounds very violent.
She could be dead after the game.
You sound like my mother.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
You mean like in the steam room?
No.
No.  You were talking about chess.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
Nothing.
What?
Peter...
You don't understand.
It's not that easy.
You must move away from the Center.
Will your power outward.
You will go alone.
I won't leave you here.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
The Fortress moves?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
Can she be forced?
Do not let the waters touch you.
You too are lonely.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
You will follow me.
And where do you lead, boy?
When did you last sleep, boy?
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
I have a cinnamon bar.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
I only want one.
We meant only to please you.
And do you think I live on air?
He didn't join them. They joined him.
They'll trample him to death!
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
I knew.
A match for your son, I think.
The new King.
We can save half a day by crossing the Stone Lake.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
...Office 2702.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
May I go to the cinema?
When I say I love you.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Risky business, isn't it?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Poor darling, and then?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
You say it just to calm me!
Huh? That's smart!
...Composer.
Messina.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
No...
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I'll make it.
I've seen it before.
Yes?
It's a special day isn't it?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Then why?
You've just decided, is that right?
Where?
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Red flags man.
Not our problem.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
That's me.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Mammoth.
You're amazing.
Come on Mr. Parker.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
Water?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Hello!
To death?
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Yes.
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Hi!
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I'm going to fill it right now.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
What was that all about?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
What did they look like?
How much, do you think?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Where have you been?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
That's right.
I'll take that as a no.
What?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Because they got wet.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
I don't know.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Licensed attorney or family member?
I know. He has it sent out.
You almost had me fooled.
Yes, you are.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Why?
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
So?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
In that case, maybe Heyworth got fellated by a brunette and Brooke caught him.
What the hell is that for?
Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world.
So now you're -- ?
Is he the only one?
No -- it's just -- not me.
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Your what?
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Harvard. Law school.
You got into Harvard Law?
Now I am.
I didn't mean --
Pink ones.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Elle?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
We come watch... we come watch...
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You... you're a beast!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
I didn't know... I --
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
No, wait... please... listen...
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Gump, is it?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Will you lead me to her?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
Fine-looking army.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Beware.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
Certainly understandable.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Hold, Jack!  Don't strike!
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
There isn't much time!
Been telling you that all along, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Will you explain what's going on?
He'll not escape me.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
I detest serpents.
Oh, dear.
I'll go search for it.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Jack!
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I don't want it on me.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
What's this now?
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
And charmed, of course.
In every way.
That was in jest.
Jest with me then.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Be fair, Oona.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
You've been inside?
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
What are you doing up so early?
Are you his friend?
My mother would die.
We're not gonna do anything.
What's the point of this?
Does everything have to have a point?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
A sink?
I hate to ask about a window.
Oh.
Forty.
I hate this job.
I didn't recognize you!
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
Hello?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
It'll be fine.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I know the feeling.
What I'm not.
That's not true.
What kind of house?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Good for you.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
God, you look like crap, George.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I used to live here.
It's not breakfast yet.
I dreamed about your house last night.
With your hands or your tongue?
Where's Sam?
You brought your kids?
It's been a while.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Been thinking?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
Don't even...I'm there.
What the fuck?
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
To shave your chest?
After the kids are back in school.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Despite you.
Sam took them to a movie.
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
What did you say?
Yes, it is.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Comfortable?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Claude Banks.
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
What ain't there?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
This fork is filthy.
So?
What does that mean?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
You get ketchup?
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Him?
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Go where, Ray?
Back to New York for starters.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
Why the hell not?
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
I'm all right.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
It'll be too late.
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Appreciate it.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Hello, Cassius.
No!
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
Try an angel.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
So far, so good. Now what?
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Everything's fine, pop.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
You followed him?
I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
Adrian?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Sometimes, sure.
Yes...
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
How do you want us?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Why?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
What's wrong, Available?
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
K.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
Of course.
You know something.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
It's different now. Help me.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
They won't believe us.
Don't ever let go.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
Things change!
What kind of jewel is this?
What people?
What's that?
Come with us.
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
Hello.
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
Are you ready to put him in?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Stay? They lived together all their years?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
It's me...
Hi.
Okay...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
We should stop seeing each other.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
You liked it.
Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you my man?
You killed him.
Where's the bathroom?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Okay. Thanks.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
The wife killer?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
You talk to him?
I wouldn't know how.
What about yesterday?
What is this, Rogoff?
A headache?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
My... My head.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
What's that?
Who's it from?
Does it say anything on the tape?
What's that? Another tape?
Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I missed you.
Last time I saw you.
Whatiya mean?
It was weird...
I was?
Hey... Sheila.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Not even a radio?
A what?
Good morning, Lovey.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Yes.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
They were in a quandary, and—
Charming chap.
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
It's unbelievable.
Huh?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Leaving?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
How do you do?
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
So there are others?
That's intelligent.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Oh, good heavens, no!
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
When was all this?
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
You're startled?
Yes, charming.
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
What do you want?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
Yes.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Then it's done.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You're lying, aren't you?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
George, what do you think you're doing?
George, come back!
Let me up! Let me up!
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Why not?
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
was saying—
In for what?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Why?
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
The hell happened?
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
Cowan--
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I wasn't scared...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Sir--
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
What are you doing?
It's marble.
Sure.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Nowhere.
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Yeah?  What's up?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Forget that guy --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
She died?
She grew up.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Lara --
Don't worry, Lamar.
What?
John --
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
You're certain?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I need help with her.
Sean -- you're not real.
Wanna hear something funny?
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I forgive you.
The precogs were wrong.
The what?
You don't seem all that proud.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
So there is a way to fool the system?
What?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
We could have lunch together.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Yeah.
When served warm --
Thank you very much, sir.
So?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
He's okay.
What the fuck was that about?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
You talk to Max today?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Yeah? You sure?
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
You driving her?
What's that?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
A million. Easy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Where's the drop?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Taken care of?
It's important.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
Any time, bro.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
I know the number.
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Nice work.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Who's driving her?
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
They didn't say an address?
Motherfucker...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the hell did you do?
What's up?
We're not getting whacked.
Nothing, man.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
We don't need guns.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
Cool. See you later.
Yes?
'Strapped?'
Don't drag my ass into this --
Ow, shit...
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Nah, man...
So whenever we want...
No. What is it?
Can I borrow a piece of --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
We're square.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
What they call you?
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
Why?
When?
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
You know it.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Elijah who?
What do you do with your time?
Where am I gonna start?
I don't know how.
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
I see your point.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
Dear heart, where are you?
I'm tired of praying.
Brother Earl.
Let some of us come down there.
I assumed...
Just what is your question?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
I ain't stupid.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What mission?
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
You're too small to be Bogart.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Might be all right.
You want to be the head man?
They talked about me like
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
[What is his name?]
[Who pays you?]
[What money?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[Lucky how?]
[And?]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
Were you provided with a gun?
What do you mean, I'm here?
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Who's Emilio?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Why do you ask?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
You're late.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
I don't believe you.
Where are you?
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
I like him, Mom.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
She's young. She'll get over it.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I could see she likes you.
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
Waddaya gonna do now?
All right, I'll see you!
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Oh.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
What happen?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
You come up here often?
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
Yes, I know.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
Marty...
Please...
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
You say something?
Are you kidding?
I'll see you around.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Sure, what?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
Hello, Ma.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Tomatoes.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
You gonna get married.
Put on your blue suit...
Don't bring her to the house no more.
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hello, Ralph.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
He coming home right now.
Tommy...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Never this close.
Epidural hematoma?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
What's the initials 'MP' stand for, Hawkeye?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
We're a good team.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Ravenous. What about you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Give us this day our daily...
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
No, no, that one.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Same here.
Of course not.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
Just in dreams?
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
What's the bastard really like?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Yes!
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Ted Sheldon.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
All set, Ann?
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
What letter?
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
In what man!
What John Doe?
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who's got him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Grubbel's here. See? 
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Join the John Doe Club.
I trust him.
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Uh-huh.
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Floor seats.
You're my hero.
You want me to go up with you?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Hold on a second here.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
What do you got on Korda?
Only at the very end.
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
Is there something wrong with that?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Tell me what you need.
I'm not good at lying.
Why?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We won!
He's cutting down the visibility.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
I worship you.
Maybe you should be.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Yeah?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Scott...
You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
Why?
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
Wake up?!
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
You are not a God.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
Have communications contact all interface centers.  Tell them due to high demand, we're at full capacity and so temporarily there's no room for anyone else on the system.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
There was no need to kill her.
Insurance.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
I wasn't with you.
Male.
We've got him locked!
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Anybody see anything?
I see... a fox
Two thirty three a.m.
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
And how do we release the power?
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Just shut your gap!
"Basically".
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
Awwh, Charlie.
Life knocked me back.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
And now you have everything.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
How's Bugsy doin'?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I can just imagine.
I'm already late.
So what is the problem?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
They're friends of our enemy.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
We can operate around these guys.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
And what do you want out of this?
Spare us.
Where's the stiff?
Jesus.
Anything!
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Uhh - martini?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
DEATH!!
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Who?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
All right. You can come.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
We like to think so, yeah.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
What pictures?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Where to?
Are you sure you got my bag in?
You mean it's dangerous?
This way?
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
But it *isn't*?
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Tell me why!
What's this, Diz?
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Did you like the first act?
Yeah. What about the second act?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
What dame?
Why do I always laugh at that?
My friends?
Diz--
Good idea. When?
Any time.
Okay--I mean--
Diz!
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
Y-yes, Jim.
Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been exaggerated some--
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Yes. Come in.
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Mr. President!
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Mr. President--
Oh, now--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Now, Amos, now--  What?
What's your name?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Convene?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
A *day*!
Yes, I see that.
We're over in the House.
Thanks very much.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No complaints.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Do you want to dictate them?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
A camp! Well!
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
What do you mean?
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
That's him. Let him in.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
Jim, you don't have to--
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Maybe he won't get up.
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Do I actually *see* this--?
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Senator Paine.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Yes, but I—
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Have you seen the papers?
You said I was a lady in distress.
I've often thought about going back.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
With pay!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Had the boys follow us.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
How's it going? Okay?
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Sit over there, will you?
I wish you luck, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
He's what?
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Are your parents living?
You're going to New York with us.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
What's that?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
What two policemen?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
What's that?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
What are you doing for lunch?
What?
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
What do you want to know?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Where am I supposed to eat?
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Sure.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
What would you do?
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
No.
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
So whose route is this?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
You're upset.
Is it something you've heard about me?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Transference.
Which show was that?
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you wait for me?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Where was this?
What happened today?
What are you talking about?
What did he want you to do?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
This is great!
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
Sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
A doll?
I can tell you anything else.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
Things got a lot worse.
Where ya going? I've got a million questions.
I'm honored.
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Sorry...
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
When?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Who the hell are these guys?
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
Altar boys?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Goin' somewhere?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about?
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Where are they taking him?
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
So who's the broad?
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
Every damn day.
No, I mean --
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
You two!
You don't believe in curses, huh?
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
Is he supposed to look like that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Have you no respect for the dead?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
I know you knew I'd know.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
I thought you were done?
He was the last time I saw him.
When was that?
Much less go outside.
Sounds good to me.
Yes!
It's me... Elizabeth.
He's dead.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Just a waitress.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Then why are you here?
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
What's your real name?
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
There's a big difference.
GET MAD!
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Let's go.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Firepower costs money.
Wow.
This looks like a job for Superman --
And there's the Sphinx.
The who?
To us!
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
Oh no.
We've got lift off!
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir?
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Would you like some brandy?
Thank you, Napoleon.
I would like both of you to read this.  Please read it aloud.
No...
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Were you in love with him?
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Promise me.
Promises mean nothing.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
But you will not... be safe...
I believe you sent for me.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
That's all I can say.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
Yes, I wrote it.
You wrote it.
You could hear them?
Do you like music?
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Yes, sir.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Anything you need.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Alright, I'll remember that.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
Why you say that?
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Nobody!
Man, this a cool house.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Damn, you got a stalker.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
Why?
So.
What you mean, so?
Blow.
You go first.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
You're welcome, Unc.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
You did all this for me?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
It's alright.
Why for?  Them boys are real player haters.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Thanks for the help.
Ah damn.  Damn.
I can't feel my legs no more.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Mr. Nasty time?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Yes, I'm listening.
What's your point?
This says "invitation only".
Again.
I want'to talk to her.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
Keep it.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
What are you going to do!?
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
What do you figure he done with it?
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
Here they come.
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
O, she's all right.
I'll light the lamp.
Where's Ruby?
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
What can we do, Mother?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Tricked us!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John...
Now can I tell?
Don't you hurt her!
Up river.
Story, honey? Why, what story?
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
Yes. Yes.
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Now! Where's it hid, honey?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
Mm-hm.
I'll tell you a secret.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Yes; John's bad.
I'm hungry.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
What do you want?
I been bad!
You'll whip me!
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Slept like a rock.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Much better.
You used me, daddy!
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
I won't.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
You okay?
Just sleep now, Mom.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
Or it might be the firing squad!
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
He's cutting our throat...
Misha! Misha!
What a lovely room you have here.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Good morning, Your Highness.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Is this satisfactory?
We can wait.
Let's do that.
Razinin.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.
What for... why?
Me?
Can I help you?
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
How long does it take a man to land?
Why do you need my finger?
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Then you don't want me to go there.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Thank you. Thank you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Do you hear that?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
You know I want to...
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Will you smile?
Just smile.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
You see I couldn't shout that.
I promise... I swear.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
...and we won't clench our fist...
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Did I hear something about jewels?
What does he say?
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Is this your new dress suit?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
All right, I'll listen.
Now, please, Swana.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
That's all right... I grow on people.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I told you to go, madame.
Good morning, Comrade.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
May I ask why?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Executive clemency ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
Who?
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Sir?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... never complain, never explain, John ...
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
How?
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Oh, my goodness ...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Mein Kampf?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Why?
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
Uh, wait ...
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
Syracuse.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Of them.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
Amen to that.
I'll concede in the morning.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Dick, don't...
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Then I'll be there for you.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Yes.
Hiding what?
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard.  On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
That man that shot you died in prison.
No money in his room there?
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
Try "old" on for size.
Who's he in trouble with then?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
...This month's checks.
Yes Sheriff.
I thought it was a car afire.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Don't hurt no one.
I mean, would you care to join me.
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Not like that. Not like you say.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
What're you doin', baby?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Promise?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
What makes you say that?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Where does he work?
What's this about?
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
With what?
You already asked me that.
Now. We close now.
Sir?
Everything.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
Uh-huh.
When did you last see him.
Yessir.
Well enough.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
I'm sorry.
What about one forty-two.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
How would you describe him?
Cast iron?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
I got an overcoat on.
No sir.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
It wasn't a woman.
Jesus...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Need something else?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Do you know who I am?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
...what're you saying?
...I don't think I know that hospital.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Why do they keep calling you George?
What happened when you were twelve?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
Why are you doing this to me?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Thanks...
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
What was that?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
...like the water purifiers?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Did you love it?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
...this is your sweater, right?
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
No, that should be more than --
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
So you believed the bartender. Why?
What doesn't?
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
What did you say?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Ass right.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
That's right, honey.
That's good, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
A million dollars.
It was a moment a weakness!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Pete... I do apologize.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
What for?
You... in the Navy?
Why?
Yeah, I know.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I want to fly jets, sir!
What did you call me?
What did you call me, boy?
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
God help you, Lynette!
What did you tell him about the baby?
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
He didn't give you much choice.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
That was great.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
What's the matter?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
Hey, you guys still awake?
No problem, but who's Susan?
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
You're welcome.
Stop it!  Stop it!
You got an idea?
Not that one.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Asshole.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
I mean it!
Can we come in?
You don't look so good.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
A what?
Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
That's highly inappropriate.
Cut it back a little bit.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Something's weird.
What?
Ever read any Poe?
Fuck him.
Damn it!
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
Do it.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
I was trying not to tell you...
I'm sorry, Mom.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
Tyrone...
Lemme see that rifle son...
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
You got it. Berkeley?
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
We're working on that...
So talk...
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Just a kid.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
This cool the heat off you any?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
No.
That would be nice.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Am I one of that sort?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You don't know him very well, do you?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
If I fail, you fail.
Perhaps.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
You learned her lessons better than I.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
That's right.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
I don't care.  I hate him.
It's Mister Marion.
A long time ago...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
I am, I think.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
Goodbye, Francis.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Put those away.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan.  At least, I used to.
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Bite?
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Yes.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
Yes, but--
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
You stole my boat.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
I'll torture it out of you.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
It's a pirate medallion.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Come on!
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Blast it, I'm already awake!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
We had time to get to know each other.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Why are brothering with that?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Depends.
Jack!
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
She let it escape because she wants me to die.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Yeah?  So what?
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
The replicators?
No!  Well, not those exact words.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Been out for six months now.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
They did it to me!
Yes.
Mostly caffeine diuretics.  Help you go to the bathroom.
Got it.
What do these replicators do to people?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Blame the victim.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
I could go with you.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
That's going to fit me?
Did you go?
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
We've got to get the nanobot.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Yeah, and what might that be?
All the different ways that I could kill you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
I could have you fired right now.
What in the hell?
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Don't mind Mother.
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Do you like them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
What are you talking about?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I see.
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Fine. Have a seat.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey—  Let me know when you're quitting.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Quite so. Quite.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
Yes.
—and that—
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Traps shut!
Holy jumping swordfish!
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
I beg your pardon.
Yes.
Sure.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
The name is Smythe.
Well done, sir. Very neat.
That's puttering, sir.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
What do you mean?
It's okay. It's alright.
Does it look okay?
Bud?
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
I told you, George. I'm not going.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
It was accessible to everyone.
And where's that?
Hello Bud.
Mr. Simpson ...
What are you doing?
Get lost!
JENNIFER!
It's in your closet.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
So what's the point?
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Not directly anyhow ...
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Nothing.
... Yeah.
Are you sure?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
I like calling you David.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
I'm going to leave now.
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Because you're coming home.
How long do you think you've been here?
Bud ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
It's beautiful.
That's it.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
I have work, I can't leave.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's fine, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Why's it here?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I just want to know where she's staying.
Tell me why.
Are you watching a porno movie?
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Hi....what....what's up....?
You don't even know how much it is.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
So you think you can?
We got disconnected before....
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
You lied to me?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Yeah, not really.
Really?
Do you want to pick me up?
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What did he want?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Have a good trip.
yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Are you ok?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I don't know.
How?
Sorry about that.
How's business?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
It takes time to process --
What is this?
What happened?
Where you goin?
Hey.
Please don't do this.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
What are you doing?
Seven o'clock.
Ok.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I'll see you there.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
Put him through.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
Ok.
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
A man after my own heart...
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Shut down?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Go on, child.
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I am not a wealthy woman.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
It's not really--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
There is nothing to discuss-
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
There's a different between want and
I just want to understand--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
We're using-
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
What are movies about?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Like a bug.
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
For Christ's sake, shut up--
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
I'm Christ
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
And where you goin'?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Harder.  Take the towel off.
How do you know? You know her that good?
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Yeah, she's nice.
Huh?
You know, like bang her or anything?
What do you mean?
What did Tommy say?
Screw you, Jack.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
When?
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
I did keep an eye...
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
But you said "you."
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
It feels real good.
I can't find my ball.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Yeah, what?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
What did I do?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Never felt better.
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
I told you that --
For what?
This is Wednesday.
Wrong day?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Gunnison?
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
That's abnormal.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She's only perfect.
Keep your mind off her.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Smart girl.
Hello.
Not yet, Jeff.
It is something really important, Jeff?
Something big going on somewhere?
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
For what?
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
You mean "goodnight."
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Nothing, thank heaven.
What do you think?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Shut up. I'm all right.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
L. B. Jefferies.
You know something?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
No--
Tell him why we moved here.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Yeah!
And you dropped it?
You awake?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
Have some cigars.
You sure?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
See?  It stopped.
Is he there?
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
I just don't want trouble.
Who knows.  Plato?
We know.
Man, you're schizoid!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
My gun?
I'm sorry.
'Bye, Mom.
How!
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
They never do.
Where what was.
Dig the square wardrobe!
You were looking for me, weren't you?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
It is for me too.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
He wants the money.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Do that again.
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
You need a COAT!
Nick, I love you --
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Get your own room, Ashley.
That guy knows you?
Nick, what are you talking about?
No.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You said it a million times!
So you could get down her chimney.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I don't know.
They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
How do we take them out?
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Ain't there yet.
What?
I'm just saying.
Oh.
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
Yes.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
Who, Mr. White?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The Brewers.
What for?
Just hold on buddy boy.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Mr. Blue's dead?
What's she doin' now?
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Like hell I am.
I know.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
I'm okay.
I can' take you to a hospital.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
As opposed to good?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
Of course.
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
You takin' his side?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Who shot who?
Look of things, she doesn't.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
There's a nice boy.
Hold on.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
But the rest is right.
You're not going out to look for them?
Don't you trust me?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
Goodbye, Mary.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me.  How's she feel?
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
Yes.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Why?
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Yeah, it does.
How's that?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
And you're all alone.
We don't want to go there.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
You're so nice.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Then I know my alphabet.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Oh, sure.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
My favorite memory was when we --
It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Yes...
I know, but I've been thinking --
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Father!
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
I can do it myself.
She's right. We should stick together.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
"Fucked me."
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
What a bitch!
Mother? 
Bring her home... I guess.
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
That's right.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You've been working in that video shop too long.
That's nice.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
I beg your pardon?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
What's he know?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Which room is it?
Yes.
We can't stand here all night.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
I can't understand it at all.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Good.
But you do believe me?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you -— you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister —— whom I had lost and have found again....   
But I'm not joking.
What's that?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
And you believe that?
What a peculiar question.
But why come to me?
Wait —- there is that other favor.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
I never thought you did.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Because I have something very important to do.
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
False alarm.
Yes.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Does it bother you?
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Aren't you?
So you don't believe in therapy?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
You went out with her?
Can we look at one?
Why not?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
But if you were?
But you're planning to be?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Well, are you?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
God damn you!!
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Did you find him attractive?
What do you mean, like physically?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
What?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
No, it's nothing like that.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
Do I know you?
That's all.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Whichever you prefer.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Prettier than Ann?
No.
Could be risky.
I'm intrigued.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Plenty of room for two people.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
IBM.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Jesus!
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, nothing.
OK. But late.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah? What do I do then?
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Fools!
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Infantile regression.
You got it!
Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
In a way...
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'd forgotten.
Could I do that later?
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
. . .For his own good.
Farley!
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
THAT MINIMAL
This could be worse than the old series.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Bye.
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
My condolences.
How's it hanging, Miles?
They're from both of us.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Oh yeah.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Good. How're you?
What happened to you guys?
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I'd rather have a knife.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Huh.
So you're going to stop acting?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Nice, huh?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Pull yourself together, man.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What? Of course I like Christine.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Is it the money thing?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Let me use your phone.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
Please, Miles, please.
The plan is... you go.
Look at this!
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Oh. You mean... today?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
A paper?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
What about me?
Oh, Maya. No.
Hello?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
So what do you think?
I think it's contaminated.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Yes.
Where are you going?
Chicken Teriyaki.
They're on the roof.
Merrill!
These are D's; I need double A's.
Oh.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
They'll read our minds!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
I think we lost 'em.
Where are we?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.
Kate?
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Are you all right?
You must have known that before you came.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
It's a town...
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
Yeah?
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Where is Rae?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
Because they don't like what I want.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
This a friend of yours?
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
You wanted to see me?
What are you talking about?
You're kidding.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I got there just short of too late.
Hello, Cobb.
What brings you into my saloon?
That's the good stuff.
You really are a gambler.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
There isn't one.
Simone does not control my destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
What I do to Simone?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
How did the wall get there?
-- Please, get away from me.
You have to see her.
I need flesh and --
-- Flesh is weak.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
Your mother couldn't make it?
There was no other way.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
I read.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
I do okay.  How about you?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
No, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
This is the story.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Thank you.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
Let's take it down a notch.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Don't step in the horse manure.
What were they hiding from?
Congratulations.
No.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I don't know, Cole.
Something happened, didn't it?
Are you wigging out?
Yes, I am.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
They scare me too sometimes.
What are you thinking, Momma?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Fuck you.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
I happen to be a professional.
...Hi.
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
"With a hack-hack here --"
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
This is his room... isn't it?
It's time to make amends.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Down boy.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
What's wrong?
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
I almost thought for a second...
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Where's Mac?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Starla, it ain't --
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What?
What's she see in that douchebag?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
Sorry.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Meat.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Grant, no!
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Where'd he go?
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
All sound reasons for matrimony.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Mississippi's the other way!
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
See ya, Bandit.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
See.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Yeah?
Bandit I, do you copy?
-- How we doing?
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That's correct.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Did he give you his name?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
I've got concerns.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
That's not possible. I told you.
I'm here, where's the car?
D'you talk to'm?
I could have it sent out...
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
It's the last place they'd look.
You're finished.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
You got clicks, anything?
Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
You love her?
Got hit twice.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
You're not Gibarian...
I want to hear your version.
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
He'll let me in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Rheya.
Kelvin, you awake?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
To calm your anxiety.
We're taking a flight?
Rheya...
Book?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Not a very happy poem.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You go home.
What do you mean?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
How old were you?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Thank you.
Chris --
What do I have to do to stop it?
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Who are you, then?
I wish you wouldn't.
You want it coming back with us?
Claire!
Put it on my account, please.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Stop being nuts!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
I do care about you!
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
So.
Not if you don't want me to.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I watched TV.
I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
What about when she goes out?
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
Ever shot anyone?
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
You should'a brought the girl.
What're we having?
How about dinner tonight?
Mom and I got plans.
You coming in?
Shooting.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Oh, sure.
I know.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
Mistake?  Hey, guy, get back here!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Yeah--
Can't focus...
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Some prep school thing.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Toxic dumps, huh.
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Absolutely no class.
Poison emergency.
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Like it?
No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Is you all good Nazis?
Is you all little Adolfs?
There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Private property, bub.
Then we're all in on it?
Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
Twenty-five.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
Jawohl?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
Harry -- I'm blind!
You're crying, Animal.
Betty! Betty!
Yes, sir.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Not yet.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
What do you say, Hoffy. We'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of Barracks nine.
What radio?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Right.
You starting that again?
You did!
What's the decoy?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Give me the radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Ich weiss alles.
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
Toh-pak-cha=8A 
Where is he now?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, are you all right?
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
Can you locate them?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Yes, where would you go?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Understood. That will be all.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Response?
What did you see, Chekov?
Aye sir, coding now.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
I'll handle that later.
What is it?
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
... How long?
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Mr. Scott?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
The ship... Out of danger...?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu?
Close... There --
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
Who is this?! How dare you --
Wait! Give me a chance --
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Give me your hand and we both live.
But -- why?
... The needs of the few...
Yes... But -- how...?
Bones!...
What must I do?
Share this with no one.
Firing range, sir.
My Lord... what are your orders?
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
Say thank you.
It never rains but when it pours --
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
... Can't read you... repeat...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Jim --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Why didn't you tell me?
What?
Sir -- our shields are dropping!
They won't --
Well?
Tactical!
Aye, sir.
Try the emergency channels...
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Is the word given?
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
The power of creation --
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Very well.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
I did not think so.
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Shields activated!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
Where must you go?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Can you isolate the wave?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Yes, sir.
Cloaking device is stable... All systems normal.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Back to San Francisco.
Thanks. Cheers.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's what?
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
But Kirk...
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You tricked me.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
What are the variables...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Explain.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
Yes.
Spock...
The hell I can't
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Status?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Aye, sir. Descending.
What is it?
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
How long, Scotty?
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
But not you.
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Jak'tahla?
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Anij!
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
Captain, Geordi...?
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
I wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the Riker Maneuver...
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They're powering their forward weapons array.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Wine, women and song.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
Absolutely.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
This must be it.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
Ready to make a little history?
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Where are you from most recently?
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Cochrane?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Were the two of you... involved?
I have to...
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Good luck, sir.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
Wil... Data was down there.
What are you suggesting?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Mr. President.
Thanks...
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
They'll make it look like an accident...
It takes a lot of effort.
He's a DOCTOR!
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
I am.
Torpedo room--?
Klingon blood.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Do we report this, sir?
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
Your friends are late...
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Sorry -
Just the prototype.
Surely not.
How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
Where?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
Captain --
Gorkon's own man??
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Not as yet, sir.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
Can you remember our father?
No.
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
For how long?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
He is very observant.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Good work. The download?
A bit less florid, Data.
Alacrity would be appreciated, Commander.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
We are losing dorsal shields.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
What purpose does this serve?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
What's he doing?
Aye, sir.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
To find the head, sir?
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
What's this?
Why don't they answer our hails?
Not very chatty.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
What happened?
Looking up at the stars.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
With a full head of hair.
Why am I here?
We are.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Praetor.
Benny, there's nothing there.
What do you do?
Where's that?
Recognize this?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
It's taken on a disguise.
What?
Please...
Gear shift.
What?!
What?
Minneapolis.
Gas good?
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
What?
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Space?
Shit?
Shit... shit... what shit?
In your pocket, please...
You want to try it?
Why are you going here? What is here?
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Three nights... two days.
Why?
But I speak English.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Jennyhaydn.
What happened?
Why?
That was beautiful.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You promised you would get me to my ship.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
If you want to keep it, you can.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
My grandmother's rich.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
Can you see under the faceplate?
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
It was a man though... right?
Where are you going?
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
You saw that?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Hey, fuck you, man.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
Cut it out, Tran.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
He has his uses too.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
We should talk alone.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
I understand.  No, I'm not.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Talk to me about costs, here.
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Naw.  She won't call me.
You should feel like shit.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
All I'm saying... you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes.  I've heard stuff.
Jesus.
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I won't say anything.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Charm.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
My God, Lenny.  What is it?
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
Why?
I'm not going.
What is that?
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
She's buried.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I have 6 tons.
You... surprised me.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
My God.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Why did you go to Chicago?
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
The man knew how to dress.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
He's called a couple times.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Then there's the other issue.
What's up?
Suspect Zero.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Who are you?
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
How's the arm?
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
I already have an employer.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
How was it hard?
It does.
The poor thing. Six years?
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
Hi.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Unless she comes back first.
I mean, I need the money.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
How many strokes?
An eight.
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
Well, that's dumb.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Make someone bleed.
Not well.
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't call me ever again.
S'up Trent?
Tonight, baby.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
That was so demeaning...
I don't think so.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
...Baby...
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
No!
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That was different.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
I hear she's getting real fat.
No.
I'm sorry.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
A day.
What the fuck..?
Because he's a bitch.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...shivering...
...You're just poking at it...
...you're money...
Now go over there and get those digits.
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
You dick.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
And you?
Good.  He never doubted you.
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Understood.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
So.  I receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection.  No worries about operations, is that what you tell me?
You take care of your family?
This morning.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Barzini.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
I'll need him.
Barzini will move against you first.
You want him to stay in this country.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
I know.
What is it?
How do you know I come from America?
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Will you give this to him.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Mike, why am I out?
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael.
Michael?
How is your father?
Please say it.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
How can you be sure?
Mikey, you look beautiful!
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
And all his works?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
You're unlucky.
How do you do.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Hi Tom.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Can you mix a martini?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
What does he say?
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
He's downstairs.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
You should watch that!
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Are you okay?
What about Cortina?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Where does Dickie live?
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
How did you know that?
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
I can't later.
We'll be there.
My God.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
He's already angry, I don't think --
Tom, are you okay?
Was who Meredith?
Why lie?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Even her.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
It is a little coarse, yes.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, we're all working tonight.
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
You know what you remind me of?
But this is a porno movie.
I mean porno movies.
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
What taxi driver?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
No, why?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
No, I'm serious, really...
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah.
20 bucks?
Why you hang around with them greasers?
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Who's a killer?
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
Also clean.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Well, I just, you know...
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
You referring to your intellect, Goodspeed?  Or another portion of your= anatomy ....
I'm not a fool, Billy.
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
You've got everything?
Did you bring along something to read?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Do you have the...
I don't smoke?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
They're not bad.
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Start with what you knew then.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Thanks.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Why?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
You bet.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
I'm here.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Can we get him to the hospital?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
What's his rent?
You should watch what you say.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
When was that?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
That's my r-r-rent.
Please, sit.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
I think so.
How do you like our little hamlet?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
The little Brenner girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
Mmmm.
Mmmm.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
I wonder if you could tell me...
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
She was selling birds.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Where will we go?
I can handle it.
Where's Mitch?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Not by the thousands.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Why... 
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
How does Mother know what I like to do?
No.
Why?
But not for me.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Helping travelers.
So they united.
What do you mean?
Have we still got power?
You must be exhausted.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
For what purpose?
I don't know why.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I want you to help my little girl.
Ask this one favor --
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
Aye.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
I've heard of it.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But Richardson?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
She's unconscious.
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
Are you a doctor, too?
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
I will not have you use that name to me.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
I've ordered nothing from you.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
Was the paralysis immediate?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
You're wrong.
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Where is it? This place?
What did they give you?
The scar.
I told you, I knew your sister.
So you're going to kill him?
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
It's ok, it's ok...
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. Who?
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
I do. Every day.
You killed her!
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I leave that in your hands.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Maybe a little demonstration.
Gee, Mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
I don't believe it.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Everyone seems so-- 
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I -- I thought you were--
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
I don't like horror comics.
Time to activate Plan B.
Shut up!
They're looking at us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
We were gonna grab some food.
Where is she?!
Hey, take it easy.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
What happens in tow and a half hours?
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
I told Max eight o'clock.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Ocean air!
Smells like something died.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Oh, no.  Now what?
What did you say?
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
Max... what are you talking about?
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
This is kind of a cool place.
Go away.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Star.
Sixteen.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
I don't know who to trust.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
Childs!  That a fuse?
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What we going to do?!
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Neither will we.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
A couple of hours.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Where were the flashlights?
Why?
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
We should sleep in shifts.
What's happened?!
What else can they do?
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Vox?
Why did they built it?
I won't leave you like this.
Created?
Why?
I don't think that's going to happen.
I -- what are you?!
Dance with me...
Alex, what is it?
I've been working.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
Good night, David.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Is there a lot of illness?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
"Eloi"?
No...
My father has gone to a better place.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I'm fine.
But... what about Starks?
He's recovering on the third floor.
In where?
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
What should they be looking for?
Sure.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
You two ok?
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
You're just gonna walk?
I think I can remember what's on them.
I might not be able to.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
They've got lives to be grateful for.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I could try to...make it stop.
What case?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
The future doesn't look different?
What about the world?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Because I don't have time.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I do believe you...
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Becker does? Are you sure?
Sure.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
[Beat] I do it.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
I've been better.
That's certainly possible.
Oh shit.
What's wrong?
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Tell me.
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Where'd y'all go?
Call me back.
Who did it?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Shit!  I... I, which way?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
It's probably not a good idea.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
You think you've found your calling?
Thelma.
Now what?
Now what what?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Ready?
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
He said they're charging us with murder.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
You awake?
It'd have to be pretty good.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
You know what's happened, don't you?
What?
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
God!  It looks like the Army!
You sent that?
I'm asking you to leave.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Well? What are you waiting for?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
Dom? What are you?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Stalker, huh?
Very nice.
Healy, what I just tell you?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Who the fuck is it to you?
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Fine. Fine.
That...? Vestibule.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Lint?
So...
What?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Three different guys?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Friend. Baseball bat.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
I'd go with the seven.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
So who's the lucky guy?
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Bundt cake?
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Pat does projects all over the world.
So who you taking to the prom?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
Hm?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
You got what stuck?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
He gets it, but he's pissed.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Max.
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Hey. Nice tie.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
This is a restricted area.
I did.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Alright. Alright...
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
What did he say?
Ray --
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Cuz I'm a skin?
Cuz you're a cop.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
1868...
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
You take care.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Who did?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
X21. Come back.
What ya want?
No way. No fuckin' way.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Two miles.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
It dies. We live.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
You want to go ballistic?
Why?
You ever fly an F-14? 
Lucky charm.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
No.
Take something off.
One more.
How could you?
I hope you find him.
Sir?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Let's hope you're right!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
Saving them some paperwork.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
280, 290, 300 knots.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do I want?
That's not what I heard.
You think you can stay up with us.
What?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What'd you do?
Mav's a great flyer but....
Hear about Ice?
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
We did it.
Figured it out yet?
Nope.
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
So have I.
You won?!!!
Morning, Coogan.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
What happened to number five?
Fuck you.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
I am Quaid.
Bob?
What is it?
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Sleazy...and demure.
I'm listening.
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
What are you, my father?
Do what?
Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
I'm not your wife.
The hell you're not.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
I love you.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Forget I said wife.
This is the suitcase you gave me.
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
So...now what?
You're really leaving, huh?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
This is one big mother!
We'll take your word for it.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
You go north, I'll go south.
Civil?  I'm civil.
We playing cards tonight?
Burt!  Heather!
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
He was your snitch.
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
"Art's Supplies" is founded on trust, Mister --
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
Not at all --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
Do you have to do that?
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
What's Art Esparza?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Murder witness.
I embroidered.
I don't need sleep!
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
My mother find you?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
-- About what?
About Chinatown. What went down.
What went down?
I did two tours in 'Nam...
This and that.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
That's right.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
And why was an exception made?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I want you to kill for me.
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
I'm nearly out.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Don't get funny with me again.
Bobby's got it.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
And neither will I.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
Any friends?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
James called me last night looking for you.
Call me.
Do you want to talk?
You want a muffin?
Where are the Cookies?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
You're not mad at me?
What'll it be?
But Bob isn't real.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Hey, Jacques...
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Bobby killed a guy.
No.
I hate asparagus.
Who was that?
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
I don't know.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Abraham...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...he wants to testify...?
I wouldn't do it.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Mr. Concannon...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Tell me one?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
Hold on a second.
That's what I'd planned to...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
She getting good care over there?
I. Yes. It is.
How old is he?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I need an extension for my case.
You, you don't under...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I can't guarantee that...
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
And ask me what?
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
You got a good memory, Franky.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
How are you holding up?
You use their witness.
Yeah. I'm awake.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
She told me.
Yes, that's correct.
As I've said we had some more...
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, how about that!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
They've blocked it!
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
So is the town, I notice!
They are living creatures out there.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I don't follow.
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
Guess so.
What?  What kind of episode?
I want my kid out of here now!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
You okay, champ?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
What...happened?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Yes.
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Choice?  What kind of choice?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.
He knows.
You may not like what you hear.
Why did we begin this?
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
That's not why he's sending me.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
I gotta go.
Yes.
I feel like I got you into this.
Forget it.
How do you know?  They might.
It was so real...
Northeast sir!
You all right?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Stow away?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
What?
How long you been standing there?
Phil.  What are you doing?
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Joy, rapture...
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Artie? That you, Artie?
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
This be it?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
What's Cao Ben?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
How 'bout a beer?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You heard from Reggie?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
You ready for this?
More'n likely.
What's that, peanut?
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
How'd you know my daddy?
They have, sugar.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
If you say so.
Oh God, Sailor.
You talk to 'im some?...
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Course I am, mama.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
I knew you'd want it again...
Take care of him?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You got nice tits.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
By who?
Well?...
How are you, Crabtree?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I thought you were tinkering.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He is. Take my word for it.
Tripp.
James? My James? What's happened?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Who do you think it is?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Naturally you have copies.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Me? What can I do?
No...
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Yes. But that's not why I called...
Yea?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
Heaven?
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Yea, James.
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
Yes.
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
When we fall, we fall hard.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
What?
So, why did you take me up there?
I never said that.
But, last night...
You coming?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I'm sure.
Emily left me this morning.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
James Leer.
And the jacket?
Someone stole my car.
Grady.
And what did you say?
I lost it all.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Ouch. How many?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
I was thinking of you.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Beautiful. How's business?
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
I'm working on it.
How old is Anna?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
You need a table.
Fucking Mariners.
What's that?
Aren't you glad?
You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
Their sound is quite musical.
Something like that.
Were you watching me?
See anything interesting?
Hiya, Walter.
You don't know?
I think you do.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
It gives me headaches.
But you are taking it?
Have you seen Walter?
I'm twelve.
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
But will he... ?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
Of course.
How's that?
How do you feel about that?
You have no feelings for your niece?
I couldn't say.
Go home, Walter.
Close your eyes.
Where are you?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
There's something wrong with this picture.
You're quiet at work.
K through sixth.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
They could eat you.
So, you're not a dyke.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You mean the time you're locked away?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
And what do you tell yourself now?
You know, this is crazy.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Which brother did this?
What's your fucking problem?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
What happened?
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
Need some help?
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
They'll come out after us.
No, Bud, no... not you.
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud.  It ain't.  I'm sorry...
You better not say you missed that.
Cab One, radiation readings?
How deep?
4800 feet.  It's official.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
What kind of light?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
You already know what they are.
More so than the shark?
There's no comparison.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Yes, very much so.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Any news?
What is it, Claudia?
Then why do you say them?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
That's why I asked you...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
Then I'll see you later.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
Good night, my love.
Tell me once more.
I don't love you.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
And where do you find the models?
What other boat?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Unfortunately, no.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Thank you.
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
Yes.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Who told you this?
I'm not hungry.
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
It's not my time of month.
Should you see a doctor?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
For what?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Who?
No. I was sick.
Something I ate.
I went to my room.
And what happened?
Are you married?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Who?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Do you?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
What did you do?
I can't.
That you're a mistake?
Why?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're stupid.
To help me.
Because I'm in trouble.
It came out of me.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
I ate.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
A wastepaper basket.
Do you know who put it there?
Yes.
Frightened.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
I don't know.
I'll have a decision by next week.
When?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
The one up on the third floor?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
What business is it of yours..?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
... Thank you.
You were a smoker?
No-one.
Yes.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I am...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Aquittal.
Oh, some time in January.
Oh, Dear God...
About what?
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
No, it reminds me.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
How  ?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Was it you?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
The usual ten per cent?
Shurrup!
Are you now?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
Yeah, grotesque.
I don't care.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Get him out of here!!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
We do.
You haven't, you're just late.  Oh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.
I don't think that bit's right.
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Is it ... is it, really?
The big hammer?
But that's not like a real person at all.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Is she?
See you.
Parading's better!
And what's it all come to in the end?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Me!
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
Anything to spare?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
I hope he fell off.
We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.
You needn't bother.
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Hi Norm!
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Now, look here, Norm ...
No, not me.
Temper! Temper!
Eh, where's my grandfather?
I'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller than you.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Oh... God... am I cold...
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Hell, we're equipped --
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Breathe deeply.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
What?
Why, what's wrong?
Where does that go?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
Now what's wrong?
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Yeah?
Where are we?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
Food-storage room!
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Is it dead?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Are you alright?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Where're they headed?
What's going on?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
Deal.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Hold it, hold it...
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
Thanks.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Do you believe him?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Where'd you leave them?
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
May I come in?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Just some coffee.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Just like it.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
You have no right to say such things!
What do you take me for?
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Very well, plainly and distinctly. Although I consider it unnecessary - because you know as well as I, what I am about to say.  Lloyd may leave Karen, but he will not leave Karen for you.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Yes, Addison.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
I was there. An eyewitness.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Right here. A minute ago.
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
When I'm guest of honor?
Thirty minutes, forty minutes! What of it?
For instance what?
Thank you.
What's all over?
Addison-!
Gone.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Don't calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
What would you like? Texas?
Hello, what's your name?
Why.
So few come back...
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
No.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
She's got to meet you-
If I only knew how...
You're not going, are you?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I think she would cheer.
You won't forget it?
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
I think I know...
Addison wants me to play it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, don't go...
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Lloyd, what happened...?
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
That was a pity...
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Where is she?
When you do, let me in on it.
Twentyish. It isn't important.
How do you mean?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
To you, too?
I never said it was!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
But what could she do?
Promise.
Yeah?
All right, what do we know?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
See her?  Get anything?
Were you eyebrow reading?
Who's first?
Sure.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--we will--
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--shit--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
I think that's him.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Well of course.
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
I've got a lot of energy.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
On the orders of Haldeman?
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
--there's nothing new in it--
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
I think.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
FBI too?
What happens when the baby comes?
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
How senior?
--what do you think?--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
So?
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
To where?
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Where?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
You can't believe that.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
When so ordered.
A boy or a girl?
The what to what?
Sorry.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Great evening, isn't it?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
All right, I got some scotch.
This.  Right now.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Why is this?
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Why are you doing this?
Hi...
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
You got it, stud.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Gotta go.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Dad!  I know!
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
Like how?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Contact, dude.
Dude, prom sucks.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
I think you need your balls reattached.
<u>Yeah</u>!
Here, babe.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like an underground club?
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
This looks familiar...
Holy mother of God...
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
What...?
No wonder he let her go.
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
You on drugs? Huh?
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Another step and he's dead!
Not you too -
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Because Gaston was after it.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Enough. Cut him loose.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Merde.
Where is your home, Anya?
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I have my reasons.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
By pulling my hair?!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
Every Russian family has one..
Don't let me go!
Do you remember this?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Perhaps you could convince her?
Come on.
Hey!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
It's an important issue.
You're like New York. You're an island.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Well, why not?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Two minutes, Alvy.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Oh!
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Get him!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Hi. Hi, hi.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
All right.
Oh, right.
You want your tennis stuff?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Well... thank you again.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Fifteen years, huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
I know.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
it's my first time.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Okay.
Yeah?
No.
Yeah?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
M'hm.
And blind people, crippled...
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Mine.
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Well, have you ever made love high?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
I didn't follow you!
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
It was just great!
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
I don't know.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Happy birthday.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Oh, good. Okay.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Oh-
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
Oh, I'm sorry!
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Whatta you mean?
Just give me the license, please.
Yeah, watch the road!
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
You like this house, Max?
There are no twos, Max.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
She was going through my pocketbook!
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Well, hi!
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Yeah.
I was a great beauty.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Isn't Skye amazing?
And you've only just met.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
I'd say it was down.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Why would she care?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You should have brought him.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
He's not going tonight.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Anymore.
When does he graduate high school?
And?
There's a test, you know.
I adore him.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Take your time, Jer.
Yes.
Cal, too?
Anyone else?
Don't.
Don't do this!
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
That's under lock and key.
It's a Calder.
Has she called?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
The infamous dog?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
No.  No.  Let me tell you something.  Directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  The sleep depravation alone.
And Ryan works at home.
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
I think he's really angry with me too.
Medallions.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Sally?
Yes.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Not at all.
Do you need anything else?
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Are you asking me to marry you?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
I wasn't finished.
I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Invisible!
I'm Princess Bala.
You dance...
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
Worker!  Come back here now!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Yes?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
You did?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Oh, no, sir!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
No.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
So I see.
Oh.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
How many of those drinks did you have?
What is it?
The mirror -- it's broken.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I am. Let me get the cards.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
What for?
Sure.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
Who'd care?
There's a call for you --
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you supposed to?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
I see you bought some napkins.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
The dishes?
Are you all right?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Yes, of course.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
You like?  It's all yours.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Hi, Baxter.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
I'm not sure.
What's this -- you packing?
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
The party's over.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Please -- just let me sleep.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
I want you back, Fran.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
I have that date -- remember?
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Where are you headed?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
How about a drink ?
Rangers, eh?
Let's talk about you.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Chef.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
They nail him for it bad ?
Would he remember you ?
What does that mean ?
Spooky.
Who is he?
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Why did you come to ... my province.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's the pain?
I had immense plans.
Yes...
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
You knew him best.
Were you with him, when...
Nah.
Which one's the Colonel's?
You hear it again?
What's this tiger shit?
Captain Willard?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
What if I say no.
They're in order -- it's perfectly clean -- just check with ComSec- Intel like I said.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
95   CONTINUED:
She's dead.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
You should know something.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Leave it here.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Desmond.
Surviving is what I know --
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Have to get these wet things off.
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
You broke the radio, remember?
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
You hear me?  Ben?
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
His name?
Uh, Udall?
I want you to go on this trip.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
And?
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Grouchy?
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Melvin...
I think you gotta camp it here...
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Is there a problem?
You're right.  Talking too much again.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
Yes.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Why?
Because I'm done.
With computers.
The C.I.A.?
More or less.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
After that?
Did it ever bother James Bond?
Several.
Hey, where are you?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
You should knock.
Transmits and receives.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
What?
Jesus, if someone had --
No?
Why?
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Is this becoming complicated?
Uh-huh.
I'm not normal.
It's possible.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Why didn't you fade?
That's correct.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Because it's in English?
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
I'm an idiot?
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Why don't we go together?
Red or white?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Damn!
You're kidding.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
No!
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
But we could go to London and live in England.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Okay?
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
And take Jiri with you?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
We had a deal!
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
So, he didn't fire you?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
Have you lost all control of this city?
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
With you.
I don't want his money.
It could help with a new car --
That's over. Way over.
He wants to show now.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I told him to leave me alone.
I'm thinking.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'They won't.'
'Is it really me?'
What's with the friggin numbers?
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
Like you'd know.
What is that?
Saturn. Beautiful.
I haven't been nice to you.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
What does that mean?!
She great or what?
It's only 7:30.
We're doing something -- ?
What do you actually know with religion?
Loved?
Come on.
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I should have told you sooner --
Nope.
Anything you want.
Now? We just --
It's gone now.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Where did you get -- ?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
How was school today?
Here's your jacket!
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Dad, you seen the drill?
The sunrise? What for?
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
Who, me?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
AM or PM?
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Marty.
How did you know?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Thanks for everything, Pro.
That's what he told you, huh?
Then why'd you do it?
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
No, you're not either.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
No.
Holly.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Well, stop the world.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Don't.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Yeah.
This your place?
Just thinking.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Hi.
What?
Planet 10?
Got a casualty list?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
The girl I remind you of.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
How did she die?  I wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
It's a spittin' image.
So where's Buckaroo?
I see.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
...This'll sometimes help.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And I could tell you some stories –
...Got a sweetheart?
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
You're leaving?
So they say.
We gotta call the police –
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's okay... It's okay...
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Big fuckin' deal.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
How's not smoking?
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
What was she like?
Catherine Tramell.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
You did it for me.
Do you have a cigarette?
Yes, you do.
Did I miss something?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Why not?
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
She wiped out her whole family.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
Fine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
No.
About three months before I met you.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Why not?
Why?
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
He was murdered.
You have the right to an attorney.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Thanks.
I hope I helped you out.
She misses me.
Was she ever suspect?
I don't think it's funny.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Maybe the maid did it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Keep your three o'clock.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
She's a suspect.
When's your show?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Do you ever get sick of it?
It's in New Jersey.
Ignorant art?
That's good. At least they're interested.
What's wrong?
Do you still love her?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
What's with the wigs?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
These are great.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Jean, your parents are here.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
Should there be?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry – fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
... babies.
Is that the best quality you have?
Yeah, it's the best one.
I'll take the whole tin.
How can I ever thank you?
You're a fast mover.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
A what?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I need this?
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Hanging on every word.
A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
You killed me, Batman killed me, Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
What is it?
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Is there something wrong, sir?
I love you, old man.
What seems to be the problem?
Oxbridge Academy?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
If we could relay the sunlight-
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
But he's never said a word-
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Her name is Pamela Isley.  I saw her talking to Gordon.  She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
How about dangerous curves?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
Scholarly research?
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
...Afraid.
...A bat.
We all wear masks.
I haven't had much luck with women...
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
Just ones this beautiful.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
Touchy, touchy.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
...You gonna kill me?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
Not until you do that thing I like.  On se tue pour des mesnonges. J'ai gache ma vie...  Woah. Harsh toke.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
I understand.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
And what happens if we say no?
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
What were you thinking?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!!  Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
You okay?
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Hi,
Sort of half.....
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
Two dollars please.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds.  I'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Welsh.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
What a dork. Huh huh.
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Me first.
Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Well where is she?!
Uh... Attention, attention! We're looking for that chick with the big boobs.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Dill-wad...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
...Two...
They look like a couple of kids chief.
I see it. I don't get it.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Where are his pants?
Really? That's where we're from.
Who sent ya?
Uh, ten uh...
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
She's ready.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
What?
I don't think we survived the crash.
Cabin fever, hon?
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>You</u> left me.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
She's only fourteen...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
What is going on?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Are you Juno, our case worker?
About what?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
I want to be dead too.
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I... I don't know what your name is.
No, dummy.  Two.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
You've got to help them.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
... sheets.
They're... not here anymore.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
Otho, that's terrible.
... Straight out?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
No, Robert.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
I agree.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Chauncey!
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Can you see well?
... Are you sure you like it?
I certainly do.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I want to tell Eve.
Yes.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
... That is a very small room.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Yes.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
I live here.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Have you served in the Army?
But you won't sign, correct?
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
Try again.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
No, that won't do any good.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... What do you make of all this?
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
No, sir.
Good. Anything else?
Ben!
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Yes, I did.
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Morning.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
What are you doing?
You were him last night, weren't you?
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
What's that?
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
Maxine...
Let me try.
I know. I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Moving story.
Who told you?
What'll you have?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Yikes.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
You're glowing again.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No. Don't be an ass.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Fork ah did?
Yes, my dear?
Thank you, Floris.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Count me in.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
I'm getting divorced.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
We have to meet.
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Great then.
Lotte called me.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
You've got to be kidding.
Yeah what?!
What want ye, girl child?
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
I likes yellow.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You still know.
No. Sorry.
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
Baby, don't be like that.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
Back stiff?
No, let her rest.
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
It's her, ain't it?
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You was friends.
Till she showed herself.
That's so.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
Just me.
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
All he can. All he can.
Sethe?
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Hey!!
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
I know my rights.
She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man!
NUSSING!
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
What's this?
What--
Who has your undies, Walter?
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
In the briefcase?
I thought you might know, man.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
From who?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
But he's--
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Am I wrong!
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
The what?
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Walter--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
Yeah.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
And the fucking money!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Oh, shit.
Wha.
Yeah?
Dude here.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
Is this a--what day is this?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Well?  Aren't you?
I'm not--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
I'll heal.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Anyone else make it?
You're hurting me.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
I don't like it.
What's going on?
We want to attract them, not scare them off.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Tell me something, Skid --
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Who dies first?
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
You shouldn't be here.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
It won't work on you.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I was afraid that might happen.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
What?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
He killed them?
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
What do you mean?
Domini?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
Mrs. Leavitt--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Jesus.
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
I can't.
The, uh, blur there.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
The witch?
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
What about night?
English.
Fire escape??
Fucking owl!
Nobody's going anywhere--
That's a "j."
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
What're you nuts--
Why?
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
I should check on Anna.
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
Does she, goddamnit??
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
....Ma'am?
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Thanks, Meurice.
Who was it?
Thanks.
...You all right?
...You called me this morning.
...That's what's important.
I own the place.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
He needs a room, Dusty.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Sure don't.
Well now you do.
No.
What's the matter?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
What do you think?
Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
...Why?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Well.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
It used to make me laugh .but.
Yes. Frank-
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I love you Don with all my heart.
You. what?
I did. are you?
Shh. I'll tell you.
Who, Dorothy?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Oh yeah?
That's too bad.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Where are they?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
What happened to him?
I'm here, aren't I?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
So. what's next?
That sounds good.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You were late.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey?. Why?
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
No.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Go ahead.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Where do you guys want to count?
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
What is?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Goodness.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
You?
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
What type of planes do you have?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
Diego Delgado, please?
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
Please, continue.
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What?
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Today.
Surprised to see me?
Mexico.
Barbara.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate.
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Beautiful girls?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tell Mom, you know...
What do you guys want?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
No, that's alright.
What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
What do you want?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
Where are you going?
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I fucked up.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
For instance, something like this?
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Sail.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Yes.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection!
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Why did you come by?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Who found him?
She didn't.  She just left.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Why?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
No.
I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
High school?
Where did you meet him?
What did he say?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
Dristan nasal spray.
Three fifteen.
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
I thought the subject was sex?
Can we get out of here?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Is it against the law?
Hello?
Hi.  It's Frank.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
Yeah.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Yeah.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
This is not relaxing.
She sounds like quite a woman.
I'll talk to him later.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
What time did you leave?
It had to get there somehow.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Well, there's a problem.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
'82.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Carolyn!
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
They got heat in Michigan.
Roseman Bridge?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Francesca.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Smells like dirt.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Are you all right?
No. But I love them just the same.
But it's not the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
Francesca?
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
WHY?
What about us? What about me?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
'Bout 4:30.
Want anything special for dinner?
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
What happened?
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Don't feed that dog.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Are you nuts?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Where's the gangsta of love?
We can climb out.
That's some terrible shit.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Wh-wh-whooo?
You got a nice crib here.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
I said, no thanks.
Let me see your hand.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
How did you get in here?
Have you ever been inside?
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
What else does she say?
Cinn?
Where is it?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
What are we doing down here?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
But --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
All right!  Where's the key?
I can't.  I can't.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
No!  They're still on their way.
No.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What happened to them?
It's not here, Caesar.
Where, then?
You need the money just like we do.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
They were in a car accident.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
I should be going.
Lick me.
What?  They ain't there?
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Me?  Why?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
I guessed you were straight black.
A favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Thanks.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
He's a launderer?
How long have you been with him?
The redistribution of wealth?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Yes.
You think I'm lying?
Is that what you think?
You said he washed the money?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
He does it right in front of him.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
What if he doesn't run?
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
...they won't let you go...
So now you know.
Keep it. 
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
Yes.  Is he there?
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I need a ride.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Listen to what you want.
That's what I'm saying.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
Who paid the bill?
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx.

This your store?
You have ID?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
What?
Sir...
-- he accessed the account --
<u>Where am I</u>?
How did I get here?
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
I think we'd better have a look.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What do I have to do.
Her name is Jill.
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Remember how they used to stick out?
Ah ...
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
What's she done?
Jack, she's innocent!
Shut up!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
You think these are tits don't you?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
We've got both.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Will you please turn back.
Get away!
I'm going to open it!
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Oh, good!
The refund for Tuttle!
He is dead.
Damn! Blast!
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
This is your dream girl, is it?
You remember Samuel, my son.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
This is an emergency!
Hello. Mr Lowry?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Are we?
what? ... Oh ... 
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
In that time, you ever have sex?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Sleeping in the back.
You're going to live.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
No way, man.
You never know.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Did you see my father?
He's working a double shift.
Not as good as Nino's.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Five years.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where you going?
What do you think?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Would you like to come in?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
What?
You packing up tonight?
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Watch? --
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Define your terms.
Do you feel good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
What?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Speaking.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
We came from Washington.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Almost immediately.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
Should I...
No, I don't think so.
Bad manners.
Yes.  That's right.
I really have to go.
That's okay.
...good-bye then.
I'll speak to you.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
They said it would be okay if...
How's it going?
So he was indicted?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
What?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?
Okay.  Good night.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
I knew what you meant.
Where's the bathroom?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Are you nervous, Walter?
Is the manager cooperating?
Hi Walter.
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
You think I'm creative?
Of course I do!
Just about anything, Walter.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Maybe so...
What's the matter with you?
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I wonder what his deal is.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
What is it, your laundry?
Where'd ya buy that?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
You better hold off on the bubbly.
What do you have in the box?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
I also saw the girl give you this.
You are?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Oh, OK.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
Figures.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Something like that.
What show is this?
It's the news, Buffy.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
I don't understand.
You left me a message?
Hi there.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
I'll back that up.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
You sure?
Thanks.
A dress.
I'm going to the dance.
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Are you okay?
Why don't we see a movie?
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Time to do what?
What, um...  What do we do?
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!
But you threw a knife at my head!
Oh.  Sorry.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Same one.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Another distraction.  It's not right.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Okay, let's go.
And Spring Fling.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
I really was way way too too.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
You can learn to like it.
This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
Switch nostrils?
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Nuke?!
I know what it is.
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
It's Skip, for you.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Aren't we all?
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
What happened?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
Did you call me a cocksucker?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
Fastball.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You been in the Majors?
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
No.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
I don't believe in fighting.
No way.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Hi, Jimmy.  Want a ride?
No.
Where's Ebby?
Eight and twenty-four.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
I'm serious. No interference.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
She's not here, Sam.
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
In so many words, yes.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
No, no it's okay.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All right.
Yeah.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Hey, she came to talk...
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
What people?
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
It's me.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
Okay. You come by the house?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Half of everything is mine.
I...
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Certainly.  Senator.
Okay. Just take it easy.
I-I'll do it.
Any change?
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
You all right?
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
It's chinchilla.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
I gotta tell ya...
Okay?
Yeah.
With Jennifer.
Who were you with?
I ought to fuckin' have you committed. You fuckin' do that again,  I'll f-, I'll f-
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
How many kids do you have?
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
Here we go!
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Oh.
Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
Carmine left?
Stay out of the way!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
And I mean... that's no good.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Ace.
Mm.
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
Am I right?
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What? What?
I don't - 
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Yeah.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm sorry.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Here.
He called you right here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Smarten up.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Mm.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Fuck you!
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Yeah.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has a real spirit.
I better go report this in...
I've been looking for you.
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Winning.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
I still have one left...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Have you got to tell her your life story?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
You don't understand.
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Did you hear that click?
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
You're all three of you in that van?
Now I have -- it's a long story.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
259-7881.
What's happening?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Why are we stopping?
What's your point?
Naturally.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Know what else is in here?
Five ... six.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Who are you working for?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Sure.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
We're waiting on you.
Are you trying to panic the women?
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
Yeah?
None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
Who were you talking to?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Seems not.
Can I make a quick call?
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
He gave me a look.
Saw that one.
He's still looking, Col.
Thank you.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
No.
Scottish?
That should make her happy.
He wants me to perform for him.
Why?
Like what?
Jesus Christ!
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Give it over, Dil --
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
You think that's wise?
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Are you pretending yet?
Don't ask me in.
So I got it wrong, then.
Shouldn't be, Dil
You could say that.
I'm not sure.
You'd do anything for me?
And you wouldn't leave me?
No.
What?
In a manner of speaking.
You tried.
What's Fergus?
Do I?
Stop it, Dil --
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Tough work, that.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
What do you mean?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
What the fuck is this?
Should blow you away, you know that?
Who is he?
Eat something, would you?
You're the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face.
What makes you think that?
Not in your nature.
And you know the funny thing?
No.
What?
Don't I know it.
You could have said no.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Why did you sign up?
Best game in the world.
Best game in the world.
Hurry up, would you?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
My special friend.
Is it bad?
I didn't.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
What?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
Have you no feelings, woman?
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
I think that's what you ordered.
What about it?
Where's that airlines bag?
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Can you remember anything at all?
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Oh, I see.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Oh.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
Around one.
Oh.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
What now?
Do I knock or something?
Very pretty. Now what?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Which one are you?
Cutting it out.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Go on.
You mean, you're a thief?
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
Meaning what?
Yes.
You loved him?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
I don't understand.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
No -- in my room.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
I'm Regina Lampert.
Is your husband with you?
Charles is.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
You mean you and me?
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
I don't think I follow you.
What was it?
We're here.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Who is it?
Please stop -- please!
What is it about?
What?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
I get the imports.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You're grounded Friday night!
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Hi honey.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
We're seeing all the signs in town.
What happened?
You know where I can find her?
No!
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Especially not your dad.
I won't.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
Jody. Wait.
What?
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
Yes?
What?
I want you to come home with me right now, Jody.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
Yes?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
You can't bring it.
Great. 
Since when does...

...moron.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 

No.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
Borrowed.
You stole this truck.
...fine.

Oh, shit.

...I believe in live and...
 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--

Oh, shit.
I don't think we have much of a choice...
That's right.  Now,  move!
Goddamn!
 Oh...
Get over!  Get over!
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
Holy--!
 Oh...
No.  Shit.
All right.
Okay.

Then stay...
What?
You're fucked, man.
...piece of shit was worth.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...shit.
...split.
...miles.

That is loud!  I'm 
...deal with this asshole.
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Put your hand in my pants.
What?
 Come on!
 Okay.

 All right.  Okay.
Arlo!
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
  I've got the real thing!
...our ass!
What the hell?
Forty-nine point four.
Oh.
Hold this. 
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Patriotism is its own reward.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Hey, be cool.
We're worried...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Well, well, well.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Well, that just about figures for today.
...take my sorry old truck.
What?  Say again...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Is it--?
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
"I am become Death, the...
No!
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
Grateful?
...you were right, of course.  But after...
Brynner.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
This is it.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...

...quick in and out.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
This river ends at a hydro dam...
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Richard Long.
 But...
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Iced coffee.
Assumptions are always...
Where's Arlo?
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Go.
Great.  All right...
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
It's not over, Brynner.
What's going on, colonel?
And where are you going?
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
Excellent.
 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout... 
...is a perfect hunter.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Call an ambulance.
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
You're the only one I can trust.

What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Do you recognize this young man?
Got that?
 Listen, Pappas...
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
Get in 


Oh.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
A ruler?
Always?
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Very.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Avocado groves?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Hello.
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
No thanks.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
That's just lovely.
How are you, Lou?
Congratulations.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Looking for someone.
Or her name?
Absolutely.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Of course.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
That's not his apartment.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
I have?
It wasn't much of a lie.
For very long?
K... Cross.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
The Valley?
What? What is it?
Why?
I gave everybody the night off.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
What were you doing there?
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Give me an example.
Going somewhere?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
I never was.
Si.
The water.
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
...Yes of course.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
Yes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
I'm working for his daughter.
Then why don't you change jobs? 
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
We'll talk about that later.
I don't care. I'll wait.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
Then where's the money?
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
From the Chronicle Building that sign is the biggest thing you can see - every floor guaranteed - let's hope it bothers them - it cost us enough.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Wasted?
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
Yes, Mr. Kane.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Ow!
What's funny now?
Where's the soap?
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
A rooster?
How old did you say you were?
Would you sing for me?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Half past eleven.
At night?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Susan, I really think -
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
You goin', Mom?
Get Dr. Corey.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Close the door, Raymond.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
Good.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
First of all - 
What's wrong, Brad?
I'm drunk.
She's going to leave you -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Hello, Brad.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
What check?
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
That must have been love.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Thompson!
Well, thanks a lot.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
What did you get?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
How long have you been smoking?
What's this?
It's not the same.
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
He was?
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
How like her.
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
Let me take you out tonight.
Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.
You open?
So?
Why?
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
She called me Brad.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
You think things would be any different now?
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
I guess.
The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Yeah.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
She's in here?
Nudie booth?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Can we talk about this later?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
Which ones?
Can you believe this?!
What?
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
Helluva game!
It's today.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
What?
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
Because I'm here.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
I'm happy.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
What responsibility?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Like ten after.
To talk to you.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I don't think so.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
A half hour.
I should start.
It's not my store.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
You calling me a liar?
Actually, that's his night job.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
No, he got hit by a bus.
The white kind.
I said go ahead.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Why do you say that?
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
I'm not out of shape!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Really?
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Twenty bucks.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I copy.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
I love you, too.
Look, I know--
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Enough.
He can handle it.
You got to go back now!
Let's be creative.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
What about you?!
Never could save a thing.
No, he's gone.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Then where the fuck is!
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Oh, my God!
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you doing--
What's the delay?
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
I don't trust him.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!
Man against nature, right Travers.
Richard Travers.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Of course. Food alright?
Help you.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Oh, aye, aye.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
You wanna be sick?
Fair hair, sir.
Through there for a bath.
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like gotten used to. Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into reception hall where the Doctor stands.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
Fine... fine.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
You have, my son.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
You like Bach?
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
It's no big deal.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
But not now?
Just had one.
...he's two floors below you.
In my office?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
Lay it on me.
What?  What did you say?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
I was with Max when he got the call.
Try?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Hello?
You prefer nights?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
What?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
I didn't throw him, he fell.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Max?  What are you doing?
Show up for what?
What difference does it make?
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
It's not bullshit.
I don't get it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Who?
I don't know.
Yeah, that.
What's at Union Station?
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
Then what are you?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Slow down.
What happened?
That's love.
Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Not for years.
You going to warn him?
What's the charge?
People do have heart attacks.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
Them who?
Yeah.
Nothing is easy.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You want something to drink?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Can you prove any of this?
Pretty scary, huh?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
They're big details, Jerry.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  John <u>Wilkes</u> Booth. Mark <u>David</u> Chapman.  Lee <u>Harvey</u> Oswald.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Liza?
Did you kill my father?!
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
You think it's a conspiracy?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
What?
Dr. Arroway --
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
Thank you?
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
That can't be right; it's only twenty-six light years away.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
No.  Please.
What kind of deal?
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
But the work --
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Champagne please.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
Ellie, what is it?
What are you so afraid of?
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Hi.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
Buck is a deal.
How'd you find me?
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I don't know, Boss.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
A cold drink? Okay?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
On my own.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
Man, it's so hot.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
But -- but --
What are you talking about?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
What?  What'd I do?
I can't, Andy.
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
I never hurt nobody...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Is he out?
If he's not out, why are they here?
Would you want to work with us on this?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
Nothing.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
How do you know that?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
Ruben.
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
The lock...
They all have one...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Michael Johnson.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Honest to God, Ruben!
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
So what have we got?
What the hell you need her for?
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
How'd you get in on the deal?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
There, that's better.
What!? They brought the car here?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
It does.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Yes.
Isn't that rather too close...?
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Hard to say.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Do we have to talk about this?
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Maybe.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
What about this one?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Ecru.
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
But what am I going to do?
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
What if it's got a pattern?
What have you done with the ring?
Tell me all.
Yeah.
I love the pillows.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
It's TV heaven.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I sure know what that feels like.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
What are we going to do?
So, another one bites the dust.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
That's a big question.
You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
Who?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
You're there now?
No.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Someone else coming?
But you were there?
Yes.
We can't.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Do I?
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
What do you want now?
Guns.   Can you get them?
Don't bullshit me.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Boy, you must be pissed.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
The Holiday Hotel.
This kind.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
Going somewhere?
Yeah, I can see that.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
Get in the car.
What happened?
Anybody know about that car outside?
How?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
And you don't speak French?
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
You ever hear of jet lag?
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
Do you think you are a real master?
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Why do you want to teach me?
You're already a thief.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
Here you must be in proper attire.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Yes.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
Then, why did you come?
I knew she would intrigue you.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Shu Lien...
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
It's Jade Fox!
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
My name.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
Does she have a name?
In a better place.  I hope.
What's goin' on, Elly?
I don't know you.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Another jolly nickname?
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Go away.
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
You what?
You promise not to say anything?
The Fountainhead.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
How are you today?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Doing what?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
What are you reading?
Sure. Have a good night.
I don't.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Lighten up.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You really want to know?
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
What was that?
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
It was nothing.
You'd do that for me?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
Just a kiss, right?
But -
Want to join me?
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Same time next week?
It works a little.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
You would not believe what--
No.
I'm at your service.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Exactly the opposite.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
I'm not in the mood.
I want to fuck.
No, I'm not.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Get off me!
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
It's Cecile.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
I need to talk to Annette.
We played backgammon?
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
What are you talking about?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Did you ever make a wish?
Did your wishes ever come true?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
She was very pretty.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
It's your play.
That's the Farren house.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
I got lots of presents.
Yes, daddy.
No, I didn't.
Just you wait!
Yes, Amy?
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
Irena. But who are you?
For as long as you'll let me.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Merry Christmas.
That's a fine-looking ring.
I wasn't singing to myself.
But she's such a nice lady.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
Why hasn't he got a head?
And does he kill people?
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
I like to see her happy.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Anything's better than Mark.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
Why would they exaggerate?
No. I don't think so.
At least your PMS is over.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
What did he say?
Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
And he was missing an arm.
Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.
Did you get rid of Mark?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
What choice do we have?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I wish I only had your problems.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
You hungry?
Knock what off?
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
On your desk.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
No really, I love knowing what people read.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Like what?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No. I was doing my laundry.
Was there anything in that washer?
Everything okay?
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
What's that supposed to mean?
Hello?
Go away. I might hurt you.
How do you know?
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
It's for you. Frida.
You can't believe this bullshit.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
What kind of animal?
Just visiting my patient.
Dammit!
You wonít regret this, sir.
You typed this report?
What now?
Then we must call the police.
Your name is John White.
Bad dreams?
I'm sorry.  About before.
What happened to you?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
No more than the usual.
Holy cow.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Dave...
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
I was a senator, you know.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Fine.
Clean.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Oh.  Excuse me.
You're kidding.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Don't do this.
So you want to go swimming?
It's fine.
Dave!
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Alan...
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Something like what...
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
I can't say.
Where are you going?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You know, secretaries and stiff.
I know. I'm sorry...
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
The Monroe?
What about the intro?
Then why did you come here?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
The hospital? 
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
What?
Oh, I have no doubt.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Mary.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
Don't come.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Yeah.
Well?
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Who else was involved in this?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
It's all right, Chet.
It does?  What?
You fucked up little prick!
Pleased to meet you.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
No.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
AHHHHHH!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Any group pictures in the annual?
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Want to come to the study group?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
What is that supposed to mean?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
From you?
From my father and Nolan.
I will be with thee straight.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
He's the owner...
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
How soon can we get up and running?
Maybe we lost them.
I'm not staying here!
I saved your life is what I did!
The thieves.
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Self sufficient...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
What is it?
Yeah...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Hanover!! Hanover!!
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
I think he knows that Joey.
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
A little to the left...
Man, don't go up there...
Joey...
Or maybe not.
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
She fucked me.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Who's going?
Nick's going?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
It won't open.
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
No. None of that.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Hey, guys...
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
Where's it gone?
Not so good.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
I... No. You do this for money?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I just wait. You know?
Huh?
You do?
You think about it?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Is he from here?
Merle --
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
I thought you might be praying.
I'm doing that too.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Where's Vince?
See you Monday.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Maybe you could use socks, Nick. Jesus, I mean, come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now.
Well, who'd you get married to?
What the hell's that for?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
No!
You're full of shit!
The fuck I did!!!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
I want to stop aging.
I'm wasting time.
Wade's in Cryo-Prison.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Sir, your limo's here.
They're going to rob that bank.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Hey, I'm eating.
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
...Have you been drinking?
What's it mean?
He went dirty and they made an example of him.
They always are.
I'm going to be a policeman.
You're lying.
And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
But I like the new one better.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
-- in gold.
But what becomes of our souls?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
You know darn well it is.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Well, I --
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Oh, Jabez.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Not all of it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
I'll get the doctor.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
I'll never get my washing done.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
It shows on your face.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Mary! Come back ...
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Consarn the consarn --
What's ailing that dog?
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Do you really think that?
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
What's that?
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
You mean -- a jury trial?
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
How 'bout some Christmas music?
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
The police...?
John.
Where are you going?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Nothing...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Roy?
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What about the kids?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jenny?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
So... that sure is something.
I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Are they on the phone still?
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Mulvaney...
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
You got Bank Americard?
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I don't want cancer.
You shouldn't start now.
Ah, Jesus...
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
But I want to know what you think.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
What can he do, he's clean...
Okay - you got your one.
I forgot she's in here.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Oh.  Run.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
No!
Why are you doing this?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
What?
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.

Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Cunt.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
We are so fucked.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
Do you know where Danang is?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
Yes?
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
And?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
What?
It's been about a year.
How long?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yo, I'm gone.
Innocent!
Be gentle, child.  Mother Sister is an old woman.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
WAKE UP!
That's my name.
Mookie, get offa da phone.
We both do.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
Feels good.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You talk to 'em.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Magic Johnson.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
Keep dreaming.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I'm listening.
How do you know this?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
No, I'm not it.
You're it.
But I came here to learn about America.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yeah. How'd you know?
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
Ooh gross.
Would you like something to drink?
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
No, I'm fine thanks.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Who's Principal Collins?
H A R R Y...
Sounds like a pirate.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Welcome to public school, my friend.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
...cause you said...
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
You're always your harshest critic.
But-
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
No one knows?
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
I know I did.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Well, I'm listening now.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What?
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Me too. I'm almost there.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Times two.
You got the Extender?
What papers?
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
My Lord!
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
What's that you're saying?
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Basically...
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Remove her gag!
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
Don't you bave a car?
The <u>women</u>?
I never thought of that.
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Mmph?  Where am I?
You'll be sitting on the right.
What is this place?
Eddie, you screwed up.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
And, cut...
I don't know.  Where?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
These shoes are itchy.
You don't understand!  The octopus is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!
Edward Wood, Sir.
H-how'd you know?!
Edward, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Better than not getting a job?
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Of course it is.  And that's why you should play the part.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
I'm no good.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
But there's plenty of other parts.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Hruphh...?
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Maybe it needs special handling.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
Did you see that?
You think she really likes him?
How you doing, Ed?
Uh-huh?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Leave her be.
Yes?

Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
How's Marcia? She all right?
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Both.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
But Al is your husband now!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
What are you talking about?
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I batted!
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
I hear the dog really liked him.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
You do though, you look great.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
Okay ...
It's... okay
That's lucky.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Page three of the Post.
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
I'm sorry.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
I need to talk.
Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Show business.
You're in show business?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Why me?
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Hi, Shari.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
No.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Sign here, please.
Thank you.
Anything wrong?
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
What d'you got?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Mr. M.?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  And so far she was running unopposed.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Uh-huh.
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
points at the motel.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Sherry... I love you.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
Yeah.
What?
What...?
Who put you up to this?
What do you want?
How's the left these days?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
But you did it anyway.
Look.  I want to see you again.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
How's it going to look on your report?
Why?
At least not anymore.
What about him?
Bud...
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Man, what're you saying?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Why?
What's this all about, lad?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Decorated?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
No.
Not good enough.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
When?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
Not a word.
DePinto's dead.
What'd he say to you?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
You've got it on tape?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
A direct one.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
What do they have to do with this?
Yeah.
What <u>is</u> that?
I'll pay you.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
Jesus!
Sorry.
How do you know so much?
How'd you have the manpower to--
Why'd you leave?
Looks like Detroit.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Them.
You sure?
What if--
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Oh my God.
Do you see anything you like?
I'm married.
Yes. I have her permission.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
I'll say.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Because my life is being ruined.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Your stuff?
I'm not his attorney.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Right.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
How could you let me find out like this?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
I see her for business.
I know, but listen--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
Are you sure you're safe?
It's really over?
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Maybe it's not connected yet.
It is fish.
DePinto?
Why?
Good. You're just what I need right now.
I know.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I <u>did</u> care how.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
--otherwise we may have to--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Listen--
What's his name?
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Bobby--
Good point.
What are you talking--
In your dreams.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
No.
Usually they take clothes.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
He's heard that it's escalated.
Calm down.
Jesus.
Jerry?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Bobby--
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Well we'd sure like to help you.
You would?
Yes. But we can't.
What?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
What about the tapes?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Yes sir.
What about--
What about the tape?
Yes?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
I don't care to bargain.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
What do you mean, poetry?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Now.
What do you hate most?
I can still taste you.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
You're wearing the thimble.
Oh dear.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
I don't know.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Or was it Toronto?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Ask him.
Where did you find that?
And you've forgotten yours.
Me?
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
How?  How can you see anything?
He needn't disturb you.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
I've been told that before.
No!
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Of course.  When?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
And what if he really is a spy?
Whoa - give me a chance!
I was looking forward to this evening.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
Go away.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women.
This is wonderful!
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Through a window.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Then don't.
Seems I am.
So what?
But Roki said--
We going somewhere?
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
True enough.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Let's do it again.
A dozen times.
I trust it's your size.
To us. To the Mask.
You were afraid of heights?
He wasn't.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
There's always a surprise.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
No way to take another day or two?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Jesus God, it's going through.
The disc is still in there.
Hang on.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Because I never assume anything.
Remind me why.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
What's chromium?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Five million dollars?
Yup.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
Course I did.
At least they made an offer.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
That's crazy -- why not?
It's not about working hard --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Is that what I think it is?
And that's what caused the contamination?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Hey.  I like working with you.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Uh-huh.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Erin?  What are you --
How do you know that?
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
I wasn't gonna --
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
We'll see.
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Ten?
You're not nothing, Erin.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What do you want, a joke?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
What's that?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
I'm embarrassed.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
He can do it.
You must survive, Luke.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
And that is why I must go.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Sir, I was wondering ...
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
You don't look angry.
That was no earthquake.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
What are you afraid of?
What are you staring at?
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Thanks to you.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
It's a lovely outpost.
We've got to find Luke.
What'd you say?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
You don't have to do this to impress me.
Closer?!
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
I have followed my feelings.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Excuse me.  I didn't mean to disturb....  What am I saying?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
With food?
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Who's that?
Give it to me.
Shit.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Where do I put ashore?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
What're you doing in here?
Who?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Perceval, you have returned!
Who is Merlin?
How? Where?
Excalibur! Is it true?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
Ye...
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
You, my lord.
Because you and the land are one.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Very well. Climb up.
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
I'm not jealous!
A lovestruck page!
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
Hello?
Hi, how'd your day go?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Where do you want this?
I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Oh, she'd love it.
Good morning Madame.
Fine thank you.
A stimulant.
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Are you sure?
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
I didn't get you?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Like what?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Wanna drink.
Are you sure?
Where's Regan's father?
What kind of stuff?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Oh............
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Oh I bet he is.
Yeah
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Well I heard differently.
Why does God let us get tired?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
St. Mike's.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Goodnight Dims.
I came to say goodbye.
What's playing.
You speak Latin?
No.
No momma.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Unlikely.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
That's to bad.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Fuck him!!!
Miss?
Is it Captain Howdy?
What's our friend's problem?
How many?
Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
Accident?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
That's not the point.
So we on tomorrow night?
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
You look awful.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
You gotta go.
So what'd we get her?
Frank?
So you'll come out, right?
Nice, huh?
It wasn't like that.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
Where the hell is she?
Last?
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Okay.
We're gonna be here a week?
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Fine.
What?
You saw wrong.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
I don't know. Some disease.
I don't know.
What's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it?  You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
You weren't there.
Right.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
So what'd you think?
No, no.  You boys are tired.
The flu.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
I'm sorry?
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
What do you mean?
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Oh, thanks.
Jack, you with us?
You're kidding me.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
Some discussion.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
How come?
Black.  Labrador.
No.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
What's the matter?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Friend.
Huh?
Nervous?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Frank said ---
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Hi.
How'd the show go?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
Nice-looking kid.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Why would he need more?
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
Thanks, Pollux.
For being one helluva guy.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Something good?
Go on.
How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
-- Castor?
Stay away from my family!
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Commander, what are you doing here?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
The hospital.
Hurry up -- the salad's getting warm and the pasta's getting cold.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
So you left her?  Just like that?
They did a pretty good job.
This is day care.  It’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
Big Ed’s.
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Like what?
What are you doing?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
No.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
What?!
I don’t think so, thank you...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Look, I don’t know what’s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Hello!
How can you do that?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
Jack...can we afford all this?
Worse, you mean...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
I could stay here forever...
Are you out of your mind?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
You’re moving...
You’re not married, are you?
Jack.
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
Mrs. Peterson.
No...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
He certainly has your number, Alan.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Damn...damn...damn...
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
What about his first born?
It's about to be a broken face.
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
You look like an eighties rock band.
It's easy for you to be patient.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Back it down, Johnny!
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
You're on fire!
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
There'll be a team of Surgeons standing by. We're prepared to remove you immediately, should anything go wrong. In any event, you must be out within sixty minutes. After that, you'll be in danger of attack.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
Listen...the Heart.
He's making a fine recovery.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
A surgeon might...
What do you mean?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
Looks like somebody declared war.
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Then don't drift down further.
Where's my daughter?
Drop that fucking money!
I don't think so. It's nice.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
I did.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Well, okay, it's -
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
Oh, he's adorable.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
Yah. Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Uh-huh.
Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots.
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
Yeah, but -
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
... I'm sorry, sir?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Ya got the car?
Twice.
...Is everything okay?
Are you calling Stan?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Mm.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Where is everybody?
Yah.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah - how are you doon?
Oh, pretty good.
...This is a nice place.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Nope.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Still missing. We're looking.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Oh, fine.
They announced it?
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
No.  I found something new.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
We need to talk.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
What does that mean?
It means it was homemade.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
Look, this is a bad time...
What are you doing here?
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
What is this?  Who did this?
Guy or girl?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
What?
Answer the question!
What?
My God, you're shot...
Hello?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
It's getting exciting now.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
How's that working out for you?
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
What list?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Is it?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
You're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Yes, I promise.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
What is this place?
No, I'm not...
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What should I have told you?
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
... is over.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
What... what are you saying?
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
I'm going to...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Damn it!  God-damn it...
Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
Why are you doing this?!
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
Appreciate something.
Look at me...
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
What are you doing?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Another premonition?
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
I've got to stop and help those people.
This is cheery.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Kalarjian?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
That's why I was there last night.
He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
4:25.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
No.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Ninety.
American?
Alright.  Home run.
I thought he was with you.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
That's an order.
What's the plan?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
Congressional Medal of Honor.
But now it's free, right?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Well, there's nobody special!
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Really?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
My agent.  I called my agent.
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Where you comin' from?!
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Yes... I... I agree...
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Your name was picked.
What girl?  I didn't notice.
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Where am I?
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Parry Parry?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
I'm going on over there...
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Alaska.
How do you know it's clean?
Can I get you anything else?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
I just can't look at you.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
It's none of your business!
That's dangerous, you know.
Swimming?
Where are you going?
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
No, it's okay.
I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Look at me.
What?
What are you doin' here?
How you treat them?
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
Wussup?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Fa what?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
She lives near Eddie?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What she look like?
My friend told me she lived around here.
You mean her.
That's what he said.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I wasn't asking.
Fletch, this is dumb.
Fletch!
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
I think I’d rather have drugs.
My pleasure.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
Oh my God!
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
You sure those doors will be open?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
She's cute as a button.
So were my parents.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Who is it?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
Act natural.
The door was unlocked.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
She moved out.
This morning.
Uh, almost.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
I want something I can print!
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
You don't know the Underhills?
But I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You're saying you need money.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
You going to be okay?
How'd you get this from her?
Ah, an obvious choice.
I came to warn you...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
It's red, Ford.
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
This is boring, guys.
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Are you okay?
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I tried to help you...!
So, did you find my dad?
Who's my real father, man?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
What about Don?
Hi, private eye guy!
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Got a wife named Angie.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you pick up the car?
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
It has to be by the end of this week.
It's your problem.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
There'll be someone else.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Nothing in there except a New York street map.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
Who is that guy?
Popeye.
What happened to you?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
I been damn careful up to now.
You remember Mary Finelli?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Frank, we need to talk...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
I'm scared.
Wait...
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
29 years...?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
What's going on?
You just burned the desk.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
What do I tell them?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
How?
Yeah, I think so...
It's not your fault, Dad.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
In my pocket.
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
John, you there?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
Sull!  What the hell!
How you feeling?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Sounds good.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
I look familiar?
A hot shot, huh?
I hear that.
Hell-
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
What was that?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Why did you come back here?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
I don't see anything.
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Darren, we better turn around.
Is that all you found?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
Ahh, nothing.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Uh...yes.  But...
Okay, give it back.
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
That's debatable.
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
Yes!
Eight times.
I'm here.
I know who you are.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
What's the problem here?
Hello...
Okay.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
It was a community service.
I'm now begging you.
Are you crazy?!
Until I hear the truth.
I've told you the truth.
About what?
That's disgusting.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
But Sean said...
So, are you having fun yet?
Yeah...a lot.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
What is your location?
I...I don't know...
I didn't mean for you to go!
Rennie...??
I used to drive a taxi.
Very big.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
What was it like?
I say we go.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
Where are you going?
He'll hate it.
Paisley Porter.
Had to be him.
What are we talking about?
Did you see the winning run score?
This could be it.
Our Peter?
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
If you're wondering about the firearm.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
What else?
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
How prominent?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Washed away.
A thousand things.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Because God loves a winner.
Washed away.
If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
How come?
Have to hurry back.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Burnt sienna.
Oh. You know him.
A little.
Engaging.
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
God gave you ten thumbs.
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
A -- a week.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
A great deal.
You've done me a great service.
Are you going to walk all the way?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
I dined at the prison.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Er, no...
No?  What's keeping you?
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Something's not right.
It's about the Director.
Suit yourself.
What about this?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
Who died?
Let's get out of here.
It's okay, Eugene.
We can't stay here.
Come on--we're taking off.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
What do you think?
Why not?
Why would we do that?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Beynon.
And you got him...
I'm in a hurry.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Fatter... some things never change.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
Fifteen minutes.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
How much?
Things can't get much worse can they?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
No, I'm not.
Two.
I'm good at that.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
You got it.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Who?
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Yes. I told him.
What do you want?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
What about?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
What about?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
So where are we going, Princess?
You sure about that?
Yeah.
Expect so.
Now tell me the truth.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Nice of you to come.
Don't know.
Where would I find him?
Where you off to?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Definitely.
They bloody hurt me.
Pension him off.
Did you sleep well?
What you going to do?
Is he?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Making a living.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
Not suede boots!
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.
They killed the goose.
I...
It's not.
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
What hard part?
What?
Huh.
Someone should rob the office.
You haven't talked to him.
What did you say?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
You're going to steal the leads?
A job with Graff.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You...
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
...you don't have to come in...
Absolutely.
You went for it.
You need money?  Is that the...
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
And why is that?
I, you know, they should be insured.
Yes.
Yes.  They are old.
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Was I?
No.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
That's great.
What?
Shelly: get in the office.
Who told you...?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Not lately it isn't.
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Yes.
...ah, fuck this...
And fifty bucks a lead.
Why?
What happened?
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Excuse me...
What?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
It was his idea.
Was it?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...
Shelly...!
Just now.
Oh, Christ.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Did I...?
Mmmm...
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Who did she call?
To change our minds.
And when was that check cashed?
I don't know.
It's not me, it's my wife.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
I...
What?
You cashed the check?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
You hear what I said?
Guess who?
You just this morning...
They took some of the con...
I have the stuff from last year's...
...you want to go out today...?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Why do you have to go?
I'm not hungry.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
We have no money for a rug.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Then why do you come to me?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Would you like some?
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
But, you told me yourself...
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
The 'patrone' is here.
Within the compound will be fine.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
What do you mean gone?
Why didn't someone tell me!
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
They can come in now.
It was a boy.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
No questions.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Why don't you sit down?
Goodbye, Michael.
The baby I lost...
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Not for a few years.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Nothing is more important.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I wasn't going to try anything.
Sure.  I loved it.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
I'm not married.
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
You're sure of that?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
You and he are not doing things?
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
I stink to high heaven right now.
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Broke is more like it.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Your family ate dripping?
What?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Do you mind?
Is this David's doing?
This David's a friend?
Did you now?
Did you kill anyone?
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
So we understand each other?
Very well put.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Do I have any other choice?
"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What was that?
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You coming, Boone?
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
You only embarrass yourself.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
I don't mind.
You're serious.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
You didn't?
How are you?
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
How's the leg?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years ...
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
I think about that night a lot...
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
One more night --
Get out --
You know my back -
And this has what to do with me?
Not my girl anymore
What do you want from me?
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Peugot convertible ...
No. That was Higgins ....
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Forget that ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
You guys are through...
Sure -
Kip -- ?
Yeah ...
You all right -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You okay -- ?
Nah. It's a scratch.
You don't think so, huh?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
What?
You boost her -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
What for -- ?
And here I am...
Very good...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
You think it can be done?
You need him...
Who's "Eleanor?"
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
You know what you got here?
What do you want, shithead?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What are you doing here, assface?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Tell him. It's okay.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Nods.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
I'm in construction.
The bag with the envelopes.
I'm gonna need some money.
What are you talking about?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
What?
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Jimmy.
Don't worry about it.
Watch this.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
The third store down.
He's with his friends.
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
All right, then.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
What?
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Oh...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
You want us to give you cash right now?
Will you take a check?
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
You're in a safe place, Will.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
What are you smiling at?
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I need someone with your kind of background.
I'll be okay.
Would you excuse us?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
What do you want to do?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
I might understand that.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Well, I can see this is pointless...
That must have taken you a long time.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
Where were you?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
You're kiddin' me.
Not to me, they're not.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
See ya.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No I haven't...
I've never seen your place.
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
What?
Why not?
Is that what you think--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Yes, I do, Will.
You're *ticklin' me!*
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Maybe the road's out.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Joad.
Joad. Tom Joad.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Have a little snort?
They never wrote you nothing?
She's settlin'.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Women is always tar'd.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Naw--not much!
Yes, ma'am.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.
No'm.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Pa! Shh!
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Ya say we're acrost?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Won't they come out here?
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
What's this?
Can you pick peaches?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
Yes I do.
You don't...
So, what are you doing now?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
I just play my own collection.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Bad people.
Unbelievable.
Do you want to get a drink first?
I think they'll probably have booze there.
Like love?
Yes.
Get the fuck outta here.
Jesus Christ!
What if I come back?
You don't understand...
How do you know?
I just know.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
They blame you for the compromise.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Does Chicago count?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
You sleeping all right in that house?
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I have a way with animals.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Maybe they should put me down too.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
What?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
That's not true!
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Yeah, you know everything!!
Started what?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
I'm sorry.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Huh-huh. You?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
They fired you?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Don't you go to school?
That's not a question, is it?
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Shit!
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Did you talk to him?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Yeah, mom?
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Oh, shit! He got me.
It's too much machine for you.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Name your stakes.
And if I win?
Make it my first born.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
I know, I know who wrote it.
You're welcome.
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What the hell was that all about?
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
What number please?
Purpose of visit?
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
So?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Brady!
Brady!
Now where are you going?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel.
No.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why?
Hi Rachel.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Where are you going?
132 to 133 this is 134.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
What are we doing?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
Hello?
I've already lost it.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Wait a minute here...
Get him out of here!
You locked yourself in.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
A man wouldn't do that...
What do we do?
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Jesus!
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
I don't like that story.
Laurie...
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
What is it, Laurie?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
You're coming with us...
Yes, she is.
Of course not.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Oh, good...
Hi.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Wow, it's the red one?
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Uh...
What?
But I'm seeing him.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
It's really sad.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Like what?
How ya doin', man?
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Well, sure.
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh!
What are you doing?!
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Aren't they great?
I know.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
But, you got four children!
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I didn't say that.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Yeah.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Oh, Mom!
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
...or films you must see or... 
What's the problem?
I can't take this anymore.
Like what?
Why?
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Doesn't she look pretty?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I know...I know.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
He's fine.
Go right over there.
Wow!
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
What are you talking about?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
True.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Ouch!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Awwww...
Oh, God...
You're crazy!  That's not true.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
Can we, can we go?
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Yeah.  Me, too.
Oh, no.
Well, I hope you've changed.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
Hi.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Uh-huh.
I can't think.
A reward for what?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Who would that be.
Evelda Drumgo.
You want to get married...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How crazy is that.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
I know her by the Back.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
They got that kind of money?
What else did I miss...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
Why did he come back?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
...they're from Baltimore....
What would <u>that</u> be?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
...young boys, still...?
Let the girl go.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Waal...
I have had many excellent meals there.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You know America?
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
Indeed we were.
...and my need for The Institution...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
...when I... 
Because you're going to help me plan a party.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Or clear your windshield with it.
I know it well.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Brazilian. 
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
...no.
What does <u>that</u> mean?
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
I..
...yes...?
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Go stand by the flagpole.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
What in the hell did you do that for?
I think your passion is terrific.
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Do you really not believe in God?
What else don't you believe in?
What do you want me to say?
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
It's not my style, okay?
Oh, I have to hear this.
So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
I don't know. Should you?
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
Did to.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
playfully shoves his hand away.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Look who I've found!
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Fruit.
I think I'm dying . . .
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
Just a couple more . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Since what?
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
What's the occasion?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
In a word? Lucrative.
Never to put you in my will.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Ambulance.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
This game is over do you hear me?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
What things do you think you've done?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I got your bail continued.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
The homeless!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
John, I know all about it.
What's the matter?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
That too.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
It's not unthinkable.
Oh my God!  Bernie!
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Who?
And the rent is okay?
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
-- institution.
No, no, no, no.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
I should.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Baby, what is it?
I'm thirsty.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Did Daddy tease you?
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
So you don't have anything concrete?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
Neil, calm down.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
It's a nice pool, isn't it?
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
Did you hear that?
Did you hear what he said?
What?
Do you remember who gave us this?
No.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
The cab's waiting!
What?
What did the thermometer say?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Promise?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
What is it?
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Lieutenant.
A few days ago.
You sure?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
The river.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
You can go first.
I would like to say goodbye.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Leaving?  For how long?
Huge.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
Yes.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Yes -- it is.
--for three hundred years.
Be careful, Conner.
What's that next to him?
I do not know -- and even if I did...
No.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
I love you, Conner.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
You kept it?
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
I understand.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
We're cool.
How about the cop?
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
Let me come get him.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Give up.
What the fuck is that?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
How did you get this number?
Yeah.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
I need to work out some stuff.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Mine, too.
Shh, they'll hear you!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
What do you want?
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
He said something about a girl --
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
She didn't answer.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
Do it.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
What's my name?
The kids are in here!
Okay.
He has lots of disks.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
What did you overhear?
The police are very busy.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You said you had no whiskey.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
What do you mean, General?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Let’s go, Jock.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Call, sir?
What cards?
You have our cards.
I will need a suite.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Let's have dinner first.
No.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Paul, don't let them die.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
They are being evacuated.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I have to stay.
What sort of plan?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Rutaganda's place?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
What do we do with all these people?
What are you doing?
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
Why the hurry, Roger?
There are soldiers.
I don't know.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
There must be some other way out.
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Is she...alright?
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Most fun I've had all day.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Good point.
You okay?
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Could we have a word?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Really? Well, let it rip.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Do something!
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
House 2, Guests 0.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Won't do any good.
Believe me, we need to.
Sara...?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
Damn it.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Are you all right?
A few years older, perhaps.
Can I do it again tonight?
It's going to hurt us!
She's here.
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
Mommy please help me!
Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
What the hell is that?
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
You're bleeding.
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
You must be a Londrigan.
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something in there.
What do you mean?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Taken what?
I figured I'd make breakfast.
How have you ... ?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  We want ...
Uh-huh.
A prize?  For what?
But how in God's name ...
Not quite.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
I miss you too.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Looks like you've been expanding your...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Anna, I think you better stay....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
What the hell....
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Anna, what are you trying to say...
I'm going to find out.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
I was the Warden?
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Oh Hudson...
Trust Leonardo....
I wanna know...
Way to go, Anna.
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
This is the worst night...
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Why George, you big softie...
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Every year?
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
I filed it yesterday.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Well, I --
...Why, this is worthless.
Awwww, buddy --
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Norville.
Oh, geez.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Not even behind your back?
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Damnit, where's my car!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Yeah, tell me about it.
...Her mother needs an operation...
Good morning, miss.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Why was the maid crying?
A mental case?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You didn't drive her mad.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
You want that?
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
You want to go?
What?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
The phone's out.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
But what?
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
A key party?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, we can talk about it.
Nobody.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I don't like coffee.
Oh.
Here you are.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Yes.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
Reverend Edwards.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
I do.
No one.
Where you going?
It's freezing.
You have to follow me?
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
What time is it?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
One more shot?
Didn't want to miss anything.
Nice kid.
My partner...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
We already did.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
I could say the same thing about you.
What time was that?
Who was the last one to see her alive?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
Did she?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
He's just rattling your cage.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
What kind of stuff?
Ran like hell to go to him...
I don't know.
I was her best friend.
Best friend?
Hey...
I don't know.
What was?
Yes.
I told you that was an accident!
You mean we are not children of Satan?
Then God does not exist...
No, my beloved, my child.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
We can do that?
That's what the one who made me said.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
It will grow back again!
You made us what we are, didn't you?
What plans?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Don't mock, Claudia...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
She's no vampire.
Yes...
But if she dies...
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
You've just done it -
You really want to be with them?
What have I done?
I can't.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
I don't pretend to know.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Lestat escaped the fire!
Yes...
Yes.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What can I do for you?
I want off this island.
I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
You get any sleep at all?
Cancer in a box.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Yeah.
Ray, we're just friend.
Ray, I can't...
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
There was a body! I swear it!
He's in it with Willis?
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?
Rio de Janeiro!
Not anymore.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
We'll only be a second, okay?
What is up with that weirdo?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk ——	he staggered.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
All the graves?
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then —- I'll not die —— I'll watch -— they shall not hurt you.
What an odd question!
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
That your father and I ——
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
What is her illness?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
There is something evil about her.
Listen to what I say --
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
George . . .
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Thank you very much.
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
When'd you see him last?
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Will you try to get some sleep?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
No charge.
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Hmmm . . .
Oh, stop that grunting.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
George, can I see you for a second?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Hello.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
With coconuts?
Uh-huh.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Eighteen.
You may kiss my hand.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Ouch!
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Do you like it?
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
It's okay, it's okay....
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
That's awful.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Why'd they decide to move?
It's still there!
Aren't you off-duty?
I never heard of a 908.
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
Positive I.D.?
No place special.  Just hanging out.
I'm going.
Oh, c'mon.
You said something about a camera.
What else you got?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
Me neither.
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Do you?
Okay, so that's it.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Probably.
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
So there's one around here.
Let's get the kid home.
Mmmm.
Mrs. Silvera?
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Because of today?  The beach?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I know, I know....
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?
What for?
That's it?
Waiting for Andy.
Terry!  You okay?
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Shut up.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
How much longer?
Until we find something.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
He's got to help or it won't work.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
When are we going out?  You and me?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
No.
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
What is it, 97 days?
Mmmm... you smell good.
They said you'd be here.
No, we'll go through here.
Honey, what is it?
Hydrophobia...
Who's going to do it?
Michael, you're not going down there.
I want that shark, Kathryn.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
Afraid I can't do that.
Still sleeping.
Believe me, I am.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
When did this happen?
Don't blame yourself.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
I'm a water-skier.
Are you really?
How come?
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
It's okay, Sean.
Calvin said it was all right.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
He was doing his job....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Then don't come any closer.
I have work....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
That....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
I'm hungry, Mom....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
I want you to give up your work....
You're having a good time....
You hungry?
Promise me....
Where do I pull off...?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
I tried to tell you...I tried....
Yes I can....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
Matt?
I wish there was something I could do....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'll do it, Jake.
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Who grows more beautiful....
She's in management....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
The van?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
So am I. But where's my money?
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Did he shut you down?
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
She wasn't lying about the van.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Well .. I didn't know that ..
I'm asking it.
I'm going up to the institute.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..
You ain't going in alone?
She's <u>not</u> "missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John.
Three or four.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Did he get you the job?
Vehicle references.
I know what a "witness" is.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
Ross told me.
He said that? What else did he say?
It's not possible right now.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Who told you?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Okay, this is working.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Didn't hear it.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
You think so?
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Well.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Yeah, I did.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I heard.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Uh, not today, but --
That's your word?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
What's wrong.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Why not --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Jerry!  You made it --
I have to ask.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Don't be silly.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Pardon me?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
What's going on, Jerry?
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Shut up!!!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
Is it a rex?
Baryonyx?
It looks intact.
Hmm?
Good luck with the fund raising.
Let me know if I can help, Alan. You’re bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Do you have any kids?
But then you never get to go in space.
You should.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Minimal.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
She's gutty.
Our chance to do what?
I have to find Kelly!
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Oh, God.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
You think this is all a joke?
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Hold it down, Nick!
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
Ask her.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
How would we cut off the lysine?
How long will this take?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Oh my God.
You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Not just every six weeks.
You can't hold it by yourself!
Dr. Grant!
I can't see.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Listen, ahh - -
These look kind of familiar.
Yes it is.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
Why?
You want to talk about this?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
I like cows.
John, John.
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
You have a map.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
What?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Are you going to plead insanity?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You saw him?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
We're down to seven minutes.
Have you worked here long?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
-- You appreciate my writing.
A true friend would do it.
No, I left it in his office.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
No, sir.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Was there something else?
Why would you suppose so?
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
No.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
-- Listen to me --
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Well -- other departments are, yes.
No, I suppose not.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
It's gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!
What?
Did you fear for your life?
Why? She's a junkie.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Didn't want you.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
My name's John Klute.
You said that.
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
How would I remember?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What're you gonna do next?
Not much point to this, is there?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Go down in my room.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
What?
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Just send me a money order.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Not unusual.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Are you closing the case?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Yes sir, we know he --
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
The prospect of losing my child.
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Wow!  French toast, really?
What about my orange juice?
Will she pick me up after school?
You're late.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Yeah?
Sleep tight.
Did mommy ever see this?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Like a principal?
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I do not, your honor, however--
No, I did not.
Did you wish to?
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
No.
A heavy drinker?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I consider it less my failure than his.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
You want what?!
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
Yeah?
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Fine.
John?
Yeah.
How the hell are you going to do that?
What?!  She wants what?!
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Look, Ted, all I--
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Uh, huh...Yeah...
What?
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Kham, Holiness.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Goodbye, Kundun.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
I am afraid.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
I accept it. What is suffering?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
How big is Tibet's army?
No. Not very big.
Where is Alsace?
Tell me.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
America, we shall see.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Yes.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
It is a difficult situation.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Why are we landing?
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Mr. Cyr!
Yup.
His head was just... bitten off.
Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
The more he thrashes, the better.
I got something on the screen.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Are you sure?
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
Oh my God.
That was an awful thing to say to me.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
Thanks for the... bandaid.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Alright, Jack!
We might as well pack.
Well...
No.
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Not yet.
What kind of backup do we have?
What?
I thought I saw...
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Hank?
Hank!
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Sorry?
Kelly--
<u>Kelly</u>--
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Never cock. Just squeeze.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
"- every day."
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
I will... I promise.
I don't know! Get me out!!
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Not yet.
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Why?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
Did you ever work with her?
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
No, I came because we need -
Five... so far.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Ahhh... Why?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
I don't know. Is it?
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
By the book, he's a sadist.
They all were.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
Why so briefly?
Did he try to?
Yes...! They were screaming.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
You know I can't make that promise.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
He did?
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Sorry to disappoint you...
Much further?
Mr Poe?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
When? How?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
"Some"?
My God, Alice.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
That is the truth!
Any powder?
Will you men help us stop the French?
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
What happened to you?
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Yes.
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Such as...?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
And?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
It's got Hazy!
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Sixpack?
Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
How much time does that give us?
Excuse me, sir...
Okay.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Who else...Sixpack.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Who were you talking to?
How is he?
What's wrong?
Your pocket?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Well, talk.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
It's a Samoan pub.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
You all right back there, mate?
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
Just carrying a bag.
Is that you, Dean?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?

It must be this one.
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
You and me, Tom.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
And that does include the amp?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Look. Go on, look.
Six.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I can fix cars.
That isn't true.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I-I can do the job, sir.
The--the officers.
Well?
Do whatever they tell you--
Because it's a job?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
And you and Private Graves--
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Nice job.
What's that for?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Same weight I always was.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Hey, it's the General.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
But they were Indians themselves.
That guy who got shot--
Well--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I have a B average.
Homework?
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
Are we going to ever see your father?
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
You own this place?
This place is a gold mine.
What?
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Senora Cruz?
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Your mother was a saint.
Seems like we have another one every week.
--Santiago.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
We have a murder?
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Fellas.
Buddy Deeds--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
Steve called for you.
The Sheriff.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
And my father?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
I don't think you can take it personally--
What about it?
Mom?
Yeah?
Can I get this?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
I only went for my last two years.
Time marches on.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
He's all yours.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Your boy, there--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Wow.
How long have you lived here?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
I been working on a few things.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
You think we need a new jail?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
That the problem, son?  You Slow?
You sell much out here?
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Payne.
How much?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Yes...
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
And you don't ask questions?
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
What did you find?
It was more than that, I think.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Nothing?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
What was that?
Oh God!
I'm here, Harry.
Don't look.
What the fuck?
What about me?
Bad show last night?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Mr. D'Amour?
We've never met.
What for?
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Are you satisfied now?
I want to see Swann face to face.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
Yes...
At birth.  I don't know you --
Harry D'Amour.
You know Vinovich?
Are they all in the business?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Is that all?
Yes.
Yes?
Can you do it?
What?
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Nix! Nix!
Ok.
Oh.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
You're possessive.
That's too scary.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
You made it.
It's bad isn't it?
We should get you to the doctor.
Well... have a good flight.
Oh?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Is this a bad time?
Alright?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Fine. Is it going ok?
What?
Yeah.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Great.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Are you sure you want to stay?
Lauren?
Uh..thanks.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Must be a spare set.
What time did you make it for?
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Is he going to be okay?
You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
May I help you?
Yes... and you are?
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
So...what did you think of the tape.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Why did he try to kill me?
So what?
Nothing yet.
Get up!!
We're going to do this.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
How much time do we have?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
He could see me.
She told me she killed them.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica, what did you do?
I hate it.
Dad around?
Need any help?
How is he?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Don't curse.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
I don't remember that.
The blue.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Coach...
Can I take your coat?
My mouth is kinda dry.
Uh-huh.
Wait...
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
I don't know sometimes.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
Hey, munchkin.
Just wanted to say good game.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
One, up.
For real?
So how come you could play basketball?
I never knew a girl that could play.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
I don't have to do what you say.
Way to hoop.
Your legs don't look broke.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
I don't.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
Yeah.
Then prove her wrong.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
Stay!
Look, I'm entering the draft.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Just something I'm trying.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
What do you mean?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
So why'd you give up ball?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
For what?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
What people?
You came out early.
What's Mom think?
No.
You smell like trouble --
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
Honey.
OPEN THE DOOR.
What?
You mind if I check things back here?
ok.
About two years ago.
Bit messy.
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
I don't have a boyfriend.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Just Jim.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Great, bye.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
ok.
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
No, what's wrong?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
What happend, what's going on?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
Put the gun down, please, boy.
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
No Can Do.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I'm a rapper.
What happend?
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
...please...
What is that?
Braces.
You don't need braces.
I don't know.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
...ah...
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --
Twelve.
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Are you asking me that?
It's all important --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And that's what you've heard?
Where are you from originally?
She's my mother.
And your father?
Kind of.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Oh yeah.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
Calm down.
I don't know a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
--- What was that?
Did your wife find out?
Then what?
Are you ok?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
That's it.
How long with Paula?
Do you know the answer to this?
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
She's asleep.
Was it a call back?
They look pretty smart, I think.
You don't want any water?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
Linda --
....it's alright....
Partridge?
Yeah.
yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
....Why does he do it...?
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
No, Louis!  No!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
It can.  I know the way.
And people close to him, who --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
How is he?
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Go on.
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
He seeks redemption.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Everyone back.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
Mother of God!
And why are you so glum?
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
It's been too long.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
I decided it this morning.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Phillippe!
The food doesn't please you?
Sire, I --
Every step of the way.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
Yeah?
What the hell happened?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What did the six-toes have to say?
Let's roll -
What?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Captain?
So where are you from?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
No, but I'm listening.
What?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
And?...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
Where are you going?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Long gone, huh?
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
How are Molly and the boy?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
Not the Bible?
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?
Read it.
Somebody hurt him?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
As long as they're dead...
What do you want to do?
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Get me a plane...
Something Lecktor said.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Where the hell's Graham!
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Yes, are you okay...?!
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Was I in an accident?
What am I doing here?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
'No' what?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Come in.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
Linda King's desk.
Why do you think I called?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
'Intimate? !"
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Come home with me.
What's this Mama shit?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Thanks for the lift.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
You went in the apartment?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
You read about it, I'm sure.
That's interesting.
I want your opinion.
I don't have one right now.
Kevlar Second Chance.
The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
So who's gonna pay for it?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
What do you mean?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
You're NOT DYING!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
Sir, do you have a problem?
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
"Philosophically"?
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
So your name's not Gorsky.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Why is he saying these things?!
Sure...
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
Goddamnit!
Hello?
Right now?
But what if...?
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
... am I dead?
Of the Resistance.
She helped you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
My name is Trinity.
How did you do that?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What the hell is this?!
Why?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
What does that mean?
I have to.
No, you're not.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
They're hacking his mind.
What do they want?
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
What just happened?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
That means it's good.
No, all we got is $40.
Well the guy over there said...
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Nervous?
Keep your mouth shut.
Shut up!
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Back so soon.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Hey, shut up.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
What's a'matter?
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
You're really crazy.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Teresa.
Did you?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
You're intolerable today.
Hey... you got stereo.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
-- Black.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Annie made them.
But what?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
...See you tomorrow night.
Drew, you're out of line.
I didn't say.
What an odd pairing.
It doesn't matter.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
In my sleep.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
It's going to be great --
Do you think I need a haircut?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
That's it?
You get not to go to jail.
What you then?
I from dat nex' place.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Yes?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Love.
I haven't.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Yes?
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Excuse me?
Yes...
Girlfriend?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I loved it.
We know so little about each other --
We know all that we need to know --
But there's so much to tell you --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
You think so?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
'Threw' you?  Where?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
Not at all.
Good morning, Bill.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
What's it like?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Are you going to eat your lunch
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Okay.  Goodnight.
That's okay.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
This universe?
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Yes?
Okay.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
Yes.
That's me.
Speak up, please.
How're you doing--?
This one.
Eddie?
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Bravo.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I don't understand.
I love him.
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
Why not?
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
47.
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
My wife.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
That's right I did, didn't I?
Thanks.
Yeah, I remember you.
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
It's isolated.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Help me.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
How can you read that again?
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Who?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
What sort of questions?
I didn't sell -
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
How do you know him?
What's wrong?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You probably.							 *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Oh, yeah...
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Where's the new drop point...?
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
I got the item.
Make it 35.
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
What friend?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
What do we got?
Verdado where?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
I am asking.  You to me.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
This is Agent James Fujima.
Okay.  What's up?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
Okay...see you soon.
...and thanks for the flowers.
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
What do you care?
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Lotta rich women back there...
Must be some mess back there.
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
Forget it.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
What you got me up here for?
Listen, I gotta have money.
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
Yessir, I can see that.
Ready for anything.
Gonna be like money from home.
You really want to do business?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
'Figgers.
The kids? Why are they...
Two kilos.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Yes...?
Just what?
Got a family back there?
What they give you?
What's wrong?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
We go back.
Work, work, work, that's all do
Yeah...?
Weird shit...?
Look, I showed you my badge...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
We'll be back at the platform in...
Wait a minute-
Is there a switch?
Just inner chambers...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Don't.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
Oh, come on, come on!
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
It bit you.
My God.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
If you wouldn't mind.
Nothing.
It has no nobility.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I DIDN'T...
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
The what?
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
A toast?
Don't talk to me like that.
What things?
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Hey, Pete.
If I can.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Newspapers?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
That'd be a first.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You picked another winner!
Feel like pleading for your life?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Nyah!
What was the top bid?
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
Not exactly.  Wallis?
Ninety-three point four million.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Exactly where is she?
And the check's in the mall.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Ethan Hunt.
They've got a book for this?
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
How do you suggest I go about it?
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.
An idea, yeah.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Yes, I believe that's right.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Nekhorvich's boss?
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Only four more cars.
But why tell us?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Where were you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Max made a deal with you?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
May I come in?
Kittridge...
Two cars.  Where are you?
Claire.
Are you damaged?
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Oh?  What's the problem?
Tell you what?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
I don't know.
Connection denied.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
Uh-huh
Cosmo?
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Where's Ma?
Bed.
Here.  Ti amo. 
In a month.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
I don't know. I got a feeling.
Why?
He knew my husband who died.
How'd he die?
Seven years ago.
Loretta.
What about Johnny?
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
This time I was trying to do everything right.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
What did I do?
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
What are you talking about?
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Kinda gaudy.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
You're late!
He's coming.
No, I'll tell him.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
You never have dessert.
Yes, on the floor.
I like this ring.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Yeah.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
I have no secrets from my family.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
So we'll sell the house.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No. But I have a hangover.
What? He's in Sicily!
No more he's not.
He's with his dying mother!
Don't fight.
He should pay.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Where is she?
A miracle. Well, that's news.
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
Have you come to make peace with me?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
What happened?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Temperature's dropping.
People home.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Is who down there?
You were a tiger last night.
The Britons.
Well, I didn't vote for you.
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
None shall pass.
I move for no man.
No, it isn't.
Had enough?
Well, what are you then?
What is your name?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
What?
Look, you're a busy man ...
There.
... You silly sod.
What?
Well?
I think I'll go for a walk.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Where are you going?
Quick!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
... I Bet you're gay.
You got my note!
You've come to rescue me?
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
How much?
You know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
What's this?
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
It's the Queen's decision.
She's busy.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Who'll bring it to me?
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I'm not married.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Aye.
Why do you think I keep her here?
They don't see it.
Ma'am.
You are here safely.
Mr Brown.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
That doesn't make him an expert.
To keep out the cold.
Have I ever let you down before--?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
What can we do?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Then they may read about me.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
The question is, do we need her?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
You can't know that for sure.
A fine choice, sir.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well?
Again?
I have no idea.
Then why are you not with him?
What do you mean?
How the hell did you do that?
Dead?
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
What's her problem?
Yeah...
Nick...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
No way.
The Police, then...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
You mean we learn the rules...
No I'm not...
What are you going to do?
You got the schematics?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Of course I am.
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
That's impossible.
So what do you think?
What did you say?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
And?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
The Cowboy??
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Sure.
... What??
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Yes.
No, no, I'm fine.
What?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Number 17.
You don't remember anything else?
Mulholland Drive?
Okay.
"You're still here?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Yes, Sir.
Nice wallets.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
No...
You must come in first place to move on !
So what do we do ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
I'm listening.
So why this ?
Is this really the time ?
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Is it over ?
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Knock yourself out.
Not yet.
When will that be ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
You did.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Do you want to go out with me ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Hello.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
Good morning.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What do you remember about her.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Pommeroy.
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
So, what's on your mind?
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
Was it a nice funeral?
Hi honey.
Sure am, who are you?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Special effects?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Hi.
What are you staring at?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
I want juice!
WHAT??
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
I think it's cool.
You would.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Hey look!
And you'd be my cousin?
It's not his fault!
What's that?
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
Committed.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
A secret, I like that.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Oh...what's that?
I think this place is just fine.
You're Nick's mother?
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Bye Aunt Rose.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Sort of?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Wanna play?
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Deceased.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Kiss me.
How's it going chef?
Did you ahh, love him?
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
He's okay isn't he?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Cause she's dying.
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Uh huh.
Can I use your bathroom first?
No.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I'm eleven and a half.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I'm trying.
Uh huh.
Heaven.
Pacifist!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Hi Vada.
So now you'll have a mother.
It is not.
Not true.
No.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
For what?
What?
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Kindred spirits.
We'll never be the same.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Impressive.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Ben Gay.
I give.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Can you watch the road?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
I've missed a step.
Jesus, we're trapped!
Ju...
I mean, he loves his job.
Uh, Kimmy...?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
I never want to go through this again.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
She's too genuine.
Hate that.
Waiter! Check, please!
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You're not eating.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Don't you throw up on boat?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I'm up against a deadline.
This thing means that much to y...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Almost three.
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Well, that just happened that time.
No.
Don't feel that way, honey.
How did you come in here?
What's wrong with her.
What did you say your name was?
She's fine.
Whose word?
What does he want?
Barbara Jean.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
National television?
Where are you going?
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Mom?
And before?
Do you like him?
Tom. You remember?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Wow!
What?
Wrong.
I'm twenty-eight
Fifteen minutes?
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What...?  0h, yes.
I can do benefits
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
We just got a gold record.
Do you study at all?
Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Thank you, sir.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Lobotomy Bay?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Not good.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Describe Mallory.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Yeah, sure.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Two guys?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Want to talk to you.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Okay.
How 'you doing?
Where was your father born?
His profession?
How 'you doin' man?
You must be new in town.
Went to college, huh?
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
How about another beer?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
That's why you come back, huh?
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Ain't your fault.
How old is your boy?
Don't push me, Duff.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
What about your boy?
I keep thinking about him.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
How come you don't hate their guts?
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Okay.
'Round town.
Just get her drunk.
How 'bout the key?
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
How often does he get like that?
Well, what're you going to do?
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
Hell, I'm just like him.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
Hi.
Let's stay here, Will.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
What's an A.I.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I've arranged for him to work with us.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
What are you talking about?
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Hey, bro.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
We run. You crack the pattern?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
How soon is soon enough?
That's not going to help.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
What is it?
I'm still going in.
Well, do you?
What?
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
No Roger from op/ed?
You're Pam?
Yeah.
Jos, that's not what we're --
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Anita!
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
Do I want to be crunched?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Have you been to any parties?
That's your story!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Better person than I.
See!
Wow. This must be big.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Is that true?
You're twenty-three years old!
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Dorothy Parker--
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Oh--yikes!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
You were attracted to me?
Into our group.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Yes.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
Where are you going?
Just out for a while.
Help me with this thing!
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, please...
Jesse, help!
There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
What the hell are you talking about?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
I think it's sad...
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Jesse, God - what happened?
Okay, I guess.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
All of them.
What's that?
I'm serious.
I'll need to take her things.
Hi Mom.
They're healing up nicely.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I know who's trying to kill you.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
To who?
We can try again.
Nancy...
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
God, that's an enormous arse.
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I forgot my bag.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
Too complicated.
I thought you were leaving.
You abide by rules like that?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Hi.  Can I come in?
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Thank you.  Shall I...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Yes...
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
That's right.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Me?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Ah... yes, enormously.
Well, fire away.
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
I did.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Martin -- your customer.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I believe I have.
No, don't think I do.
Oh God no.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
Hey.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
What?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome.  Did you find them?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Yes.
Yes.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Was it you?
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
No, Miss Ratched...
And yet you suspect her.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Tell us about it...
I was in luh-love with her.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Get up, Billy.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Sorry to have bothered you.
I wanna report a robbery!
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
A vote is before the group.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
B-B-Billy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
What is it, kid?
God Bless America.
In there.
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
They must be up there!
Yeah, where we going?
Neither do I...
Yeah, my feet are cold...
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
It doesn't help him.
What's your plan, Mack?
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
No!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Yesterday...
Bet a nickel!
Hit me!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
I'm afraid not.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Tha's your problem.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Is everything all right?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
No...
Ask her if she knows where he is?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
I'm in love with you.
Please.  I need to know.
What?...
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
You aren't?
Is something the matter?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
You're Damon Bradley?
Been here long?
Any night.
So, what's your point?
No.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
It's still the new year...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
Are you sure?
So?
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What is it?
Her brother.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Who said I was going?
Amazing...
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
A porco?
Oh.
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Where is she?
Good strategy.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers—  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the— er— as you put it— main order of business?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
They play pretty rough.
I'll get home all right now.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
What?
I don't know.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
How do you like that one?
How about another one?
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
What are you crying for?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
I just told the Father.
Get away from me.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Charley.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I want to see you, Terry.
What did you say?
...walk?
What about it?
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
—I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
What's wrong with your shoulder?
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
Forty-five bills.
So-so, Johnny.
Go on— a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Where?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
Don't let them hear you.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Nothing is worth your life.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
What can we do against them?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
I understand, Master
The time...is short.
He wants us.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
I want to speak with you, please.
Yes.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
He'd call every once in a while.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Till they got busted.
Adele?  You in there?
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
It's Richard Ripley.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Yes, she did.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You know they gonna set us up.
I get that feeling, yeah.
Hello, Daniel.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
In the trunk, yeah?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Shut up.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
I could walk out of here.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Karen, I told you not to--
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Who's sitting here?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Of course I am.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Faye Dunaway.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Who was it answered the phone?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
And your gun.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
Well, does it make sense to you?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
You goin' right back to work?
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
There were others.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
And is Foley a part of this?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
You there?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
You're a fighter?
Flyweight.
Technically.  They're separated.
What're you doing at Glades?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
No?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Faux goose down.
Are you sure they're here?
He was that good?
Sir, I --
They ready, Earl?
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Then why are you looking for her?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Land of the free.
We've always tried to beat each other.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
You were more like brothers.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
So beautiful!
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
Our doctor's gone too.
What do you get for winning?
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
Leapin' Jesus!
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Fook ya!
Let's go.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
They're waiting. Come on.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
We're going to take you home.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Would you?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
What do you know about classical music?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
But what has to be different?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I've got to go now.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Yes, sir.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
Okay.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Don't get your hopes up.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
What are you shooting for?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
All right. But this better be good.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
For me?
Yes.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Would you get that, dear?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
What are you doing?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Dancing with you.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Okay. I promise.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
You're giving me the creeps.
Am I dead or not?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
You took over for Doctor Yolander?
Is something wrong?
I think so.
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Why not?
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
One hour!
Ready for what, baby?
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
Nine.
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
What do you want?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Beckett?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
I suppose you could say that.
Except... you were gay?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Something like that.
Gay movies.
I'm fine.
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Were you recently promoted?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Why are we going to do that?
A homosexual encounter.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Lots.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
Jesus.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Power cells.
Had it with deals.
Back to the ship, huh?
Get out of our way.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
You'd die for them?
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Amazing. I'm Johns.
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
How many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
For your own fear.
We aren't completely stupid.
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Imam. Slow down.
...then we saw this.
Very big beads.
Well, what's it look like now?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
So which one caught your eye?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Take it.
Dr. Zaius --
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
Seal the cave?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
How did it go?
Yo!
Will he live?
This place is dirty, doctor.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
What happened?
What signal?
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
Can we take a dip?
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
No.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Tell him to pull back!
It's him...Landon.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
Bunker...
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Fuck you bitch.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
And you, do you believe?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
How far does this train go?
Vancouver, B.C.
Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
I haven't been invited.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
Immigration Officer?
Bank?
Your liquor laws..
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's got to be a detective.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
Anything I can do about it?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
They'll look for you.
If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
Frozen.
Including Killaine.
Magruder does.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
If I understand what you meant by that.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
I know that.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
All right. Get him.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
Private eye?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
So you're not a cop.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Where?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Send that?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Not if it clears the air.
It does.  May I go now? 
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
That leaves two strangers.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
Why should I mind?
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I have a rough idea.
That's not very kind.
I told you she's just..
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
Attributed?
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Can I give you a lift?
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Oh yes?
How nice.
Damn.  They're early.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
To the Fleet.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Perhaps I will, then.
Fuck off.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Hello.
Hello.
What about the Cromwells?
Not bad.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
Yes.
U-huh.
You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Promise?
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
You gotta earn trust.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
You never were...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Good move.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Johnny, it's the only way.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Got it.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
I know where they're going.
Shrimp and fries.
Who's the girl?
You had enough?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
What do you mean?
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Who's our back-up on this?
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
What story did you give to Davis?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
What's got Billy so spooked?
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.
You're looking well, Dutch.
Hawkins?
I think it's Hawkins.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
He's not really my uncle.
You what?
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Mr. Harris.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
Yes.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Sit... and spin.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
For the whole night?
Three hundred.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Diet coke.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let's talk some more first.
Good morning.
I sell them.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Of course.  How much?
Done.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
You're upset, huh?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Okay.
What about dinner?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
He's good at what he does.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Do I look okay?
I've never been on a plane before.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I know.  I'm glad.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Right.
I didn't think so.
What's up, where you going?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We're letting them slide?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Vivian's in sales.
You're being ridiculous.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
You broke my nose.
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
Carlos had some great rock.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Oooh, I love those.
Vivian.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Would you like to try it on?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
But what if something happens to you?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
Why should that make such a difference?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Faster!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
He's really very short on charm.
-- Fezzik, please --
The body?
What?
I brought you a special present.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
Yes.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Now?
What? What?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
Sorry.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
Get used to disappointment.
You're sure nobody's following us?
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
You guessed wrong.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Yeah, an hour.
Guess what.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
But that's cheating!
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
What kind now, Leo?
What is she gonna do here?
To failure!
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Like clockwork.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
Bismark...
The Blue Max...
People can hear you.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What do you do best?
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
How early?
The following morning. Sunday.
Or arrived with her.
No.
What do you mean?
What?
She isn't still here, is she?
Of course not.
Let's all talk about Mary.
Casharoonie!
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
With you.
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Maybe we can handle it together. 
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Without calling me?
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
What?
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
I haven't even been married once yet!
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
How can you even think a thing like that!
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
I'd like to.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Phoenix?
Crane.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
Mother, please...
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Did she talk?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
He's inherited a fortune.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I don't agree with you.
Why didn't you eat last night?
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
But it was really my fault.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Let it go.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Call the Homicide Squad!
No kiddin'.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Good night, sir.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
But I have some friends waiting.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
What was her name?
What?
Could you?
We flopped the first time out.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
'Course it does.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Buddy, you're just a child.
You better quit that.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Neither do I.
You were up late last night, Brother.
Well, a little.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
What did you say, Brother?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
No, Mother, he's lying...
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Why is it taking so long?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Is her husband sick or something?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
She does look a little peaky.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
I don't believe it.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Yes, dear, what is it?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Yes, Ma'am.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Lay off once, would you?
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
You shouldn't litter.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I can work this.
I can't believe we're stealing.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
There'll be other chances.
Can't I?
You know what I mean.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
Can't be worse than you.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You get him?
Think Zimmermann's watching?
This shit was Ming.
I can't do it, Ben.
But I have no sister.
Where am I?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
You got her warmed?
Someone who loves you.
Shall we try and go around?
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
He wasn't. I can feel it.
Yes.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Come on! Come on!
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
All wings report in.
Oh!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Told you, did he?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Janet.
Yes.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
It's just a..a party Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Oh Brad.
Weiss.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
"Sweet Transvestite"
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Who's Eddie?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Would ya like a glass of water?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
No, I don't belong here.
Yes.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
-- The legs.
Apollo?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
What?!
My side.
No doctor!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Seven minutes!
How 'bout some Cokes?
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
I say ya nothin'!
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
That's it, I'm broke.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Yeah.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
The legs must be goin'.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
I got pain an' experience too.
Yo, Benny.
...The guy's great.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya always in a bad mood --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Maybe ya better forget it.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
...I can't haul meat no more.
I'll tear his head off.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
A tweeting bird?
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
So you decided to help him after all?
I'll bet.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Aah!
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Yeah?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
No better?
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
At thy good heart's oppression.
'Tis he.
I'll not endure him.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Welcome.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
By the hour of nine.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Meaning, to court'sy.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
So what's the deal?
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
Where's the case?
Don't do it, Sam!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
You first, Edvard.
What do you mean?
We'll die if we stay here!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Then where is it?
I sent it to myself in Paris.
That's it.
Really?
And you respect him.
Of course.  Don't you?
How did you know?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Created?
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
It's been known to happen.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Coordinate what?
Where to?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
A lot of people died.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Not exactly.
And what job is that?
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
Closest and oldest.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
What's the story?
Gaelic.
Sort of!
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
What do you mean what are we going to do?
We don't know that.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
What makes you so sure?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
I can't do that.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Not bad enough to kill him.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
It's too late...
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
And you're solid on that?
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Has he?
Nothing.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
And I'd take it out on him.
How the hell did he find it?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Yeah.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Lingerie...
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
You'd do this to me?!
Dwayne -
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
This isn't right...
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Two-hundred thousand!
Wait.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
That's right.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
You lied to me.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
This is a very dangerous man.
It's my job!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Carter?
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Why LA?
It's a long story.
Slow down, baby.
Is it hot in here?
Pick it up!
Wait!  There's people down there!
I wouldn't do that!!!
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm not used to having a partner.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Hello, Benjamin.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Ricky Tan is alive.
What?!?!
What is this?
First class.
The Plaza Hotel?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
I need your help.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Shut up!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Right....
Shortcut?
You like it?
What?!
I'm sorry, Lee.
Oh no.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
What kind of assignment is that?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
Shut up!
Nobody touches me.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
Where do we find him?
Hello.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
What is he up to now?
See you at the wedding.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
And in a "V".
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.
... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?
Or a vegetarian?
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Your two cinnamon rolls.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Always a mood killer.
I'm a work in progress.
You don't know.
No.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Of course.
Can you fix it?
To who?  Are you asking me?
Well, you do have the dress.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Yes, I did.
Used?
You're a goddess!
Reporter?
It's probably because you got him fired.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
He's going to be the pastor?
What happened at the luau?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Yeah.
Nope.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
Is that all right with you?
I love you.
Nope.
Even when you were young?
Happy New Year, darling.
Walter, I'd love to --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
Turn on your radio!
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Is this crazy?
Thank you.  I love you.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
You're going to miss the train.
I love the symphony.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Are you Annie?
Howard.
What?
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
Magic.  It was magic.
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
It's me?
Grace heard it.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
All righ...
Why not?
I don't think I could really describe it.
Why not?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Seventy... eight.
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Eighty dollars.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
Dad --
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
What?!
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Stressed.
-- a slice of pizza --
What do you think?
Jed's got cables.
It was sinking.
Bye bye blackbird.
I don't know.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Listen to this --
No.
No.
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
How's Jonah taking it?
It takes time --
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Take a drink. Calm down!
What do you mean -- sex equality?
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Who? A scab?
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
What's more important than sanitation?
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Mother of God ...have mercy ...
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
Yes.
Be still ...
Alone?
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Forgot what?
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Did you see his hair color?
You like that?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Everything go?
Oh God.
It's not that easy.
Why don't you call the cops?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Can your man handle that?
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
Was he the president?
What's this?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Why?
What does that mean?
Make me an offer.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Just some buddies.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
This chink have a name?
What're your taking down?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
What's on the other end of this thing?
You're lucky, Flynne.
When is the deal going down?
Again, I thank you.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
We're in business.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Sir?
Yep.
You must be a hell a shot.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Sure, you got one?
What'd you say, Captain?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
How about I go right, sir?
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
You alright?
Yeah.
Bits and pieces.
Oh, yeah?
I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I don't think so, Captain.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
No, sir.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Maybe Caen.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Yes, Private.
Who cares?
So, where are you from?
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
What's the profile?
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
You like it?
What are you doing?
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Goodnight.
Morning.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Did he ever get rough with you?
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
What am I supposed to think?
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Thank you very much.
I'll go.
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Goodbye.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Twisted?
So what's your job this summer?
Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.
What did you say?
I just can't have any social life right now.
Yeah.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
I don't know.  I'm happy.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Yeah.
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I'm sorry.
I love you.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
I'm totally and completely serious.
I know.
She's very successful.
So what's up?
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
What's your name?
You know what, you'd like her.
Luck.
What?
I'm sorry to hear that.
All right, okay, let's talk.
Yeah, what's that?
Look -
You're not telling me something.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I need a drink.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
It kind of looks that way.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
I was just the accountant.
Pots and pans.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I'll talk to him.
Four hundred, four fifty -
I didn't do enough.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
I heard a noise.
Stop it...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
It’s over, Cotton.
Where is Sidney's father?
This is exactly what I don't want.
Go on, untie him.
Why?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
That's not the way we play the game.
Are you in danger now?
I got a surprise for you.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
I hate scary movies.
Take it off.
I get scared really easy, okay.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
How is that good news?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Yeah?
They've got her!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
You used to say that was our strength.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
What's your point?
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
What the hell are you doing?
None.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Basements creep me out.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Let's get out of here!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Yes.
How do I know their voices are --
What? She asked.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Dude. What are you doing here?
Ready?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
Oh Billy... Please... God...
Jesus, SHIT!
You lost your mom...
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
What?
I called my dad.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
So why did you dial it again?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Why do you want to know my name?
Dial someone else, okay?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Don't do this. I can't...
No it's not. It was Jason.
What?
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
No, not yet.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
At the airport.
I don't know. I guess.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
I saw him leaving wearing it.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
No you didn't.
Jesus, this place is packed.
And what would be your motive?
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Wanna another beer?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
You're crazy -- both of you.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Do they know who did it?
Thanks, Tatum.
Come on, Sid.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I bet he's pissed.
During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
No way.
I thought you dumped her for me.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
How's that?
Thank you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
What the hell's going on?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
This doesn't make any sense.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
I know.
What the fuck is that?
What?
He just may be nuts enough.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Why would we?
It is Victor.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
It was him.
We need a warrant.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What are you talking about?
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
No.
Slut.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
How's California?
But Mose Harper said...
What, Ben?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
He cometh forth like a...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
And you think we got a chance to find her?
That don't make 'em kin...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Ethan, quit it!
Stay out here.
She's not a little girl any more.
You've seen her!...She's alive?
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
I got to fetch her home...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
I have to cut his windpipe...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
You didn't tell her!
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
You are a gentleman.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Are you writing?
What is the chief part?
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
Most interesting.
And your relations?
No, your marriage bed.
Will it restore my gift?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
When?
Put his feet in.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Is it going well?
What happened to Sam?
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
Nobody. The author.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Do you think?
"But new struck nine."
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Like you, I found him not at home!
My lady!
You can bring them with a word.
There is.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Then I will go with you.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Orsino…good name
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
I . . .
Does she say so?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
You are on my ground.
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
No.
You mean immoral.
You think so?
So who's going to do it?
I can't do it.
I won't be able to.
I don't know.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
I don't know.
Not eating what?
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Well, yes.
Cameron.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
I think you're lying.
So?
Yes.
Unfeasible.
I don't thinkI can.
Are you all right?
Will you calm down.
No, no, it's different.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Later. But first -- him.
David?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You mustn't take it so badly.
What?
Two?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
What?
In this firm.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Eh --
I'm boring?
Hello.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
No.
No.
Working nights?
And he's a patient of yours?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Then what's the problem?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Maybe... why do you ask?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
Why not?
I don't know.
I don't want to see you anymore.
You're late, George.
But you don't know what happened.
What kind of treatment?
Why don't you see Lester?
Is she all right?
Like what?
No.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Okay.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Well, are you?
What?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
Yeah.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Well, what do you think?
Yeah, I think so...
It's hot in here.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
I don't know what gets into me.
-- we're kidding ourselves.
Where are you going?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
I don't know... Jackie?
What?
Wash her.
There were some shots.
Where?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Honey, what happened?
Yeah.
Yeah, baby.
George?
Go where?
Egypt!
George.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
-- well aren't you --
How many?
-- please, baby --
-- no, it'll help me, really --
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
That's all you've got to say?
What did you say?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
What do they look like?...
Well, what?
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
What can I say!
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Want a drink?
I mean, how did that happen?
Wasn't sure it was you.

Yeah.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
You do?
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I am?
Of course not.
What's that?
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Oh yeah?
I know, I'm sorry.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
That bastard.
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- I'll get in the back --
No, it's not that...
No!
Where to, Les?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Then why don't you go to sleep?
I guess so.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yeah.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Yeah.
Mommy... Mommy...!
No.
Oh,
Please...
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
Advocaat is it?
Grady?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Beg pardon?
I did?
What line of work are you in now?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
He's still asleep.
Jack!
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Thanks.
Hi.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
The moon's not down yet...
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Please, Uncle Al.
Rattling. Rustling.
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Yeah, I know. It's great!
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
You want to know what I think?
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
What about crack?  You a user?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
No... it's fine.
Yes?
Oh-huh.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Just about.  Show me again.
I know.  It's ancient.
Like this place?
Shirelles.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Wet behind the ears.
Hopeless I
Van Cartier.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
What?
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
It has come to pass.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
So I don't shop.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I think they'd understand.
Oh-huh.
Where's who?
A nun?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Right.
Joey?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Certainly not.
Excuse me?
What is that?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
... Brom Bones...
Bring Young Masbath here.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Your superiors are two days away!
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
How could he?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Father said witches live there.
Listen.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
What good is this?
In test... what?
Did your father take a loan?
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
You made this, and the drawings?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
No, but... why do you ask that?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
The skull is gone.
If you think I am behind this, say it.
I... I can't do this.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...
There was not much blood, was there?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
How are you, Bill?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Well, what did you want?
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Please Doyle, don't.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
You got that shit right.
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Are you well?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
You want to go with me?
They ort to. You're a good boy.
He ain't no count.
Naw.
You will? For sure?
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
You walk fast, don't you?
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
Yes, I guess you are.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Yeah.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
We sure like havin' you.
What brings you back?
I wouldn't never hurt them.
Okay.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Huh?
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
The Queen of England?
It's yours?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
How'd you get started?
It's kind of overwhelming.
What do you mean?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
So. Are we ready?
Every word.
She probably died.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
It means "happiness."
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
You what?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Bully for you.
Five thousand bucks.
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Seventeen.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
And these?
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Just passing through.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Mostly what.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Is your father an artist?
He's dead?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
Hey, it's you.
Appreciation for what?
Where did you get that thing?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
You work too hard, you know that?
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Medium rare, please.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And the last...?
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Well, why does it?
Maybe...?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
No spare.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
Not in those words.
Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?
I can't speak for him.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Okay, doll.
Bye.
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
What happened?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
Blow where?
But this is so humiliating.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
That's right.
What are you doing with my flowers?
I'll say there is!
Like what?
Like when?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Good night, honey.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Stay as long as you'd like.
What do you think you're doing?
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
His yacht?
Well, I'll come back later.
How did you get that bracelet?
You like it?
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Where did you girls play before?
We could pass for that.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
Who?
Another bridesmaid?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
I don't like no witnesses.
Yes, Joe.
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
Where did he conduct?
Running away?  From what?
You don't say?
You're entitled.
Want to switch berths with me?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Not very likely.
That must be it.
Your view of what?
You're society girls?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
- opening of the Opera -
I beg your pardon?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Josephine.
One of whom?
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
I don't mind if I do.
You mean we're alone on the boat?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Nothing at all?
Complete washout.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I think you're on the right track.
I never knew it could be like this.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
What's the matter, Sugar?
I know.  Every time!
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I never join nothin'.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
We got different information.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I don’t think I can go through with this.
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
I should get going.
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
No.
Nothing.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
You’re not even listening.
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
You quitting?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Not the way you’re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
I have a friend at the magazine.
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
What?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
You have more than one gynecologist?
Hi, kiddo.
What is it you do again?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Sometime, but not like this.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
That's where we come from first?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
What about Sounder?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Hi, Daddy...
He'll show up one day.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
What happened afta that?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Hi ya, Rebecca...
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
What did he want?
Well, let's get to work!
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
I wanta see Nathan.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
How would you like to go to the principal's office?
To free Terrance and Phillip.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
May I?
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
What's that?
MOM!!!
Guess.
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
Be careful, dude.
That was sweet!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
What about air strikes?
I'm needing lunch.
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
We must take action on this immediately.
But I-
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
It's from your mother.
Fight the power!
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Who's my cream puff?
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
You know I do.
You don't care.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
NAZIS!!
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
My friend the clitoris told me.
Check.
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
And what are they doing now, Mac?
On channel 10?
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
All too well, captain.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
So, are you on for the next one?
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Look at this...Jesus.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
What are we going to do?
Yeah.  We did it.
Oh my God.  What happened?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
Hopefully sooner than later.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
No, just enjoying the view.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Where's Taylor?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
What kind of man?
La da da dalala...
No kiddin'.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Theo.
Where'd you get this ball?
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
We ain't married no more.
What about bowling?
I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
Hello?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Cool!
I don't like to talk about it.
It depends.
NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What if he wants to get out?
What ever happened to just bowling?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Get that outta your mouth!
How do you want it?  The eggs.
What do you want with my dad?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan C?
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
It?
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
How do you get this thing down?
Can I come with you?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Lips still for sale?
Some unfinished business.
Very good, busyboy.
Open it, Captain!
In basic English, what does all this mean?
There's heat coming the door.
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
What if it attacks?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Thirty yards.
That's our reserve air.
Don't do it, Norman!
From what?  What's with all the security?
What's wrong with oxygen?
Wait a second --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
So?  What's the problem?
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
We had considered it.
How can he be missing?
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
You're next, Norman.
My gosh, Norman.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
What are they?
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Why should I go?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Wait a second --
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
Squids?
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Causes sleep.
I'm feeling better.
Do you fear them?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Beth, stop it!
Stop it!
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
C'mon --
Top shelf, is it?
Would it work?
Well, what's your theory?
Norman?  Where's Norman?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
I never said that.
In time for what?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
I can't believe that, Harry.
What noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You don't remember that?
Norman, where are you?
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
Her legs are in the way.
Well, press something!
There is one possibility.
She told me what you said, Norman.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Who's everyone?
I don't see anything.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Who are you anyway?
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
What is it?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
They'll find its weakness.
No!...
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Profile's wrong... there.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Johnny, wait...
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Eeuch !
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
You can't walk me home.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Zander is going for pilot, too.
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Mr. Rasczak.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
What is it, Rico ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
The Creator has not answered.
Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Yes.
You saved the ship.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
We're losing the pattern...!
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
Sure plan to.
Go you Huskies?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I...
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
And likewise.
I live there.
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...such a pleasant sound.
Mmm.
Yes...
...who...?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
You'd know better'n me.
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
I thought you had Play Practice.
Great.  Who is it...?
Thank you.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
Yes.
What've you got?
Where you going?
What?
Press still works.
Yeah, you?
...and we could get up every morning...
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
What is it, a surprise?
Yes, that's right.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
He works on the movie.
What courthouse?
What?
He's on the ph...
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
Tell it with...
What I...
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
What's his name?
Get him on the phone.
Yeah.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
She won't stop crying...
Kiss my ass.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Hi.
I had a witness I would.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..
I have to talk to you.  My wife...
We're out of money.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
How do you know you saw it?
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I...
What is that...?
You cool the broad out?
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
Bet you did.
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?
Why?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Look she's upset --
Like a big sister.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I don't want to say goodbye.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
In high school.
Ice cold water.
I hate her.  I really hate her.
There you are!
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
Excuse me --
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
So you're okay.
How do you know?
Find the bird cage?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
That's necessary, huh?
Something's up wi...
Napalm.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
Not to me.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
It's a huge moment in their life --
It's temporary.
Yet another spaghetti night.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
However many.  It's not enough.
Yes?
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
Look, you've never liked me...
I don't, but...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
So.  Hopeful.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's just not the right time t...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
You'll learn.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Rache, get out of th...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Well, they will be.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
What?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Really? How many?
Speak English.
Poison gas.
I know!
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
But what kind of pull did you have?
So? How was school today?
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Say, Ni...
OK.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Yeah. But not any more.
You want some?
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Can I see what you have so far?
Yeah. He went to Harward.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Y-yes--
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Let's move it we got company!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Well Filmore--
You're going to pay for this...
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Come on, drink up.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Good.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
At his office in the Capitol.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Where is this...thing?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Give that back to me.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
What?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Go back to sleep, baby.
Does the threat board show anything?
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
That about right?
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
To peace on earth, Major.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Then there's no chance for recall?
How long will it take to receive them all?
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
Yeah?
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
Check target approach.
Release first safety.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Recall what mistake?
What do you mean?
That's the point.
Are you sure?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
I don't anymore.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Was it okay?
What did you guys think?
Slides go with it.
Responsibility, progress.
Hey!
Hey, you said you did a video?
What's it about?
Now?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Don't let 'em fight.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Fuck it!
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
No. It didn't, Buff.
What she doin' in the van, man?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim...
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Really?
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
So, then, you're, like, available?
In what way?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Thanks. See man?
Yeah!
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
No, not really. Middle-class.
He is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Really?
You cut off your little finger?
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Uh-huh.
Who were you talking to?
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
No.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
That chick, Erica?
I hit her.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
You don't know?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Jeff! Come up here!
Seven-twenty.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Was that supposed to be me?
I don't want to hear it anymore.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Oh, yeah?
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
You're unbelievable.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
What do you mean?
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
Look, get down off my property.
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Is that your driver?
Soon.
Tim?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Don't do that.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Seriously? It's a great idea.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
Diane?  Diane!
Positive.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Jack...
I'm sorry.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
Or, I could get my own horse...
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Really...
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Thanks.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Well....
I was afraid of that.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You sure have.
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
You're tough, all right.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
No.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
It is not.  Get out.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
Well?
I wrote that with my heart.
There sure is.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
What's that?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
How about some evening clothes?
I don't need a tuxedo.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Have one of mine.
I ran into some people I knew.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Madame is waiting.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
The doctor suggested it.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
Frankly, no.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Paramount is calling.
Paramount studios.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Don't leave me.
Who didn't?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Tell me where I can find her.
We can't do that.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
It seemed that way to me.
I don't see why not.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Before you go...
I did.
What is it?
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
Why should I believe you?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
I don't want your help.
Well...I guess I can't.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Why didn't you tell me?
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
What can I do for you?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
You're wasting your breath.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You're going to take me back?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yes, mustn't stop.
What?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
But Lana, you could --
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Some people don't think it's healthy.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
I can never get a way from it.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Uh-huh.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Kent!
Do you really know Superman?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
A television set?
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Columbia.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Is this blackmail?
Fair's fair.
For what?
We've already got some.
Stone mutha.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
I didn't have my camera with me.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
We've already met.
Lots of things...
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
Storms! Floods!
She's not his mama either.
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Yes! This time we got it right!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Where were you?
It's true. It's true.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Uh...home...
But . . ..that's terrible!
What else is ballast for?
You'll have to pack quickly.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Why?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
		DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
No Paris?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Impossible? Why?
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
But why the hair?
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
No.
Hey!
It wasn't a trick!
Jealous? Of what?
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
Again???
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
La de da da...
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
Then -
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Wha'...what are you doing here?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Oh.
It must feel great.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What color underwear am I wearing?
It is for me.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
Of time, Luthor.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Ally.  That's right.
Yes...fine.
She's in trouble?
I'm...so sorry.
I...don't think so.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
I understand.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Case?
It just seems...kind of weird.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
It does concern me.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
What time's he coming home?
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
They can look forward to that.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berries.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
Did they give him special care?
I did.
You want a cup of tea or something?
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
What's a ditty again?
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Yes.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
You seem very sure about that.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Crafts?
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
No.
You've been retained?
Who did they get for that?
Dolores?
No.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Yes.
Why were you scared?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
No.
There wasn't time?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
It's okay.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
What do you mean?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
But Charlene...
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
You told him that?
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why, has he bothered you before?
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Sidney is a liar!
No...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Not "we", Sidney, you!
Uh huh.
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
She knows now.
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
In his apartment -
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
This sort of thing!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Why not you?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I tried to reach you twice -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No!  Don't kill him!
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
Where do you stand on all this?
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
What?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
You do shorthand and typing?
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I made no deal!
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
If it's too hot, open your tie.
And what was that?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
No!
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Nope.
First oboe.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright!
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Anything else?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Alright, the beige one.
I don't understand...
Okay.  Talk some more.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
He'll find us, won't he?
A girl.  You know.
And so you feel nothing.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
That stuff's two hours cold.
I just called.
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
You're the one who started running.
Nice.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Can we talk?
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
Who are "they?"
That's a lie...
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
I saw them kill him!
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
That's not true...
I have to show you...
I didn't know what else to call you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Boyfriend?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
I redecorated.  What about you?
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, almost...
What have they been doing to you?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Yeah.
Yes.
I need your car, Elizabeth.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I'll call.  I really will.
What's all this for?
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
Humor me with specifics.
Physical?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
You don't need me...
It was a different floor then...
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Fine.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
What makes you ask?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
What gentleman, Maria?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
You're joking.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
You want company?
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
Are you coming to confess?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
Get a blanket!
She needs help.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Mrs. Dudley.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
Good night, Theo.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Are you sure?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Italian.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
You think I'm staying?
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Lookin' good.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Steady on.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Again?
Well, those are the breaks.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Had a feeling it was you.
Not her brand.
How d'you mean?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
He give me your address.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Not that I recall.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
What's in Big Sur?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Don't you work with Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
What d'you mean, any happier?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
Who's looking for you?
Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
I don't.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
Hello, Mr Crane.
Uh-huh.
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
No problem!
Right! Strictly business.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Honey?
...What a knucklehead.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
You don't have to--
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
I took Doris's keys.
...who among us is in a position to say...
No thanks.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
...Ed?
Jesus...
Whuddya mean?
OK.
Mr...?
Doesn't bother me.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Why not?
I don't want to scare people.
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
The body?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
This place is a maze.
Dr. Green has to see you!
Got my hands full here.
It's still back there!
What are we talking about here?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
Like the claw.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
What do you do?
I don't want to go this way.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
What do you make of it, Margo?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
I don't understand.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
Today.
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Sure she would.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
What exactly?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I made macaroni.
I won't be here Sunday.
You hate gambling.
So why do you want to go?
You blaming me for the traffic?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
How's your hip?
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
Were you there--how do you know?
How's it going, Truman?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I think you better tell us.
What am I doing here?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Special Agent Scully --
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
We have a situation. The members are assembling.
What's that?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
You a reporter?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
-- You saw this experiment?
You're looking for a bomb.
Had you.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Get dressed, Scully.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
I don't know, Mulder.
This virus -- it... 
Been where?
Very weird.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
On whose orders?
What are you doing?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
What is it?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What do you mean, walked?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Did we go sailing?
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Is it cold in here?
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
You don't know the procedure.
I did, yeah.
What about Julia?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
What happened?
It doesn't matter...
They're hungry.
You liked him?
Oh no... No you don't.
You're kidding me.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Dr. Kent.
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
...and my lover. He was Harry.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
...quarrel?
...anyway?
They are - private - letters.
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
Do you know his number?
Come upstairs a moment.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
...your address?
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Baron Kurtz.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
What else did he tell you?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
One kilometer
Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They sound like you.
Oh, please...
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
Why no silencer?
Is he a Nazi?
Bigger and better.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Oh, yeah... 
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
No difference.
Who's Eichmann?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
I agree.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
What were you, following me?
Explain it so I can.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Fine.
Hello...?
Tell it to Hitler.
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Open it up.
That's all we've got left.
Not too fast.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Where?
Who'd you kill?
You missed on purpose.
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Dennis Leary.
Leary?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
What?
Oh, fuck you...
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
You're right.  You're fired.
Where did you two meet?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
The Mamma's there too.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Roberto?  How long?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Then tell him to wax it too.
I don't have one.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Here...  Here...
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
I'm concentrating.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
A drink to warm up?
You look adorable.
... No?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm still here.
Then, tell me a story.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Why don't you ask me?
Assassin!
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Johana... New York.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
What's your first move?
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
Want to get a drink?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
We do!
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Mom! We're eating!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
So, how was I?
You okay?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
I drink.
I sleep it off.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Sure!
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Love is different for different people.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
Yes?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Then you found the leopard --
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Get it out of here!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
Are you all right?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why’s that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess there’s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
That might depend on where you’re going.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Have you got a pen?
Mr Lombard...
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself...
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You’d have been ready for me when I turned up with ‘Sleeping Beauty’. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. “Not Leon,” you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn’t say ‘My God!’, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. “Not Leon.” Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I’d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn’t you?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
You bastard...
Here we go again.
To get me killed...?
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Have we done business before?
What about an untrained pup, white...
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
Good.
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Your secretary, huh!
Okay. Recommended...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Problems?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
What are you talking about?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Where’s your wallet?
Good reasons?
Who else knows about the boy?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
What’s the date?
Fine...
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
Okay, shitbag. I’m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Of course I am, it's just that...
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
I would like some fresh straw.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
I'll go.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Tell me...
No, but...
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Good.
We have to press home the attack!
But that was her order!
And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?
Yes, probably... maybe...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Where... where am I?
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
What were you doing when the voice came?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... You look wonderful...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
We need another ten minutes...
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Do you know how to count?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
You don't believe me anymore?
My king.
What have you done to me?
Who... who are you...?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
What do you mean, they won't come?
I don't think so.
I need to confess again.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
I don't want to wait for his call.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I need help.
And how's Yurek?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
What?
I haven't seen him.
Who told you?
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
That makes a change.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
They were taking you away.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's the matter? Are you sick?
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
But I want to help, I want to.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
I am... I was a pianist.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Baines is packing up?
Which mountains are those dear?
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
She looks tired.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What's in here then, lead?
Hello, then.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
That's right.
Yeh, go ahead.
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Hackers.
Yes sir.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You mean you blew it.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
And?
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
It was too noisy.
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
My end was only one.
But I got a train to make.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
2:00 A.M.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.
I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You really picked a winner, kid.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
No.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
You weren't hired to miss him.
For fifteen years.
Yes.  He admitted it.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Oh, Andy.
What are you talking about?
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
You hand that over to the police.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Not that scrawny little....? 
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
tried him once -
Yes.
It's been the same one for three months.
What would your mother say to that?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Only in bad weather.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
That woman!
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
So would I.
What about the suicide?
Who's your candidate?
No.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
He telephoned me today.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Who's that man?
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Don't you remember....
What did you do with the rest?
But suppose some business comes up...
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
I trust you.
What'll I do if something comes up?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How are you?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
What do you think?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Why tell me?
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Who is she?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
Hello... send him up.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I don't know.
So am I.
Not with all your money!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Well, don't they?
Yes!
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Why are you saying it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Maybe she has.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
A casual one.
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
He's not so--
You just go when I say go.
Where'd they go?
What about it?
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You got no reason to do that!
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
You said he was a deserter.
You're out of your mind.
I out rank you, that's why.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They're not going to--
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
She okay?
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
What?
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
You can't tell anybody about this.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
We're not going to do anything.
Get up and dig.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
Jesus, Jaeger.
Wes might be right about that.
We should head Northeast.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
What do you figure it is?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Somebody has to.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
What is this?
What?
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
It's got a bottom.
Maybe we should give him some water.
You're going to burn up in those.
You know I don't feel well.
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Now.
I have to... he's a G-34
Then why did you bring it up?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
You don't know.  You don't....
They don't know.
no...no, no.
It's the end.
There goes another of your disciples.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
Where is LUH?
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
We've lost SEN!
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
What was that....
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
She's not there
Remember this...?
What do you want?
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
Officer Reilly, vice.
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Go ahead.
Now wait just a fucking-
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Yeah, another round thing.
Right.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
What do ay say?
Alright!
No... No more killing.
Who are you calling, sis?
Alex, please-
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
P.E.T.N ...
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I promised her she'd be safe.
It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
I know.
Well, have you found it?
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Good morning, Major.
Umm.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Smart. London, eh?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
I hope so, too.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
Just as you say, Doctor.
Thank you, Baron.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Monescu!
The fourteenth of May.
Seven and nine!
Ah!
Certainly!
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Yes...?
Then you go into the foyer.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
The same thing.
Crimson!
<u>Adolph</u>?
And you expect me to believe that?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Goodbye...
Goodbye.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Yes, madame!
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
Yes, madame?
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
That's true.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
Yes, I saw it--but--
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
How much time?
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
The partners want to know how it's going?
Rose Calvert.
None of the stewards have seen her.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
Sure. Count me in.
You know somebody?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Mr. Dawson, I --
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
If only it were that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Jack, I --
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
This is crazy.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
It would be a nice change from you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
No-o!
You're coming back--
How about a little game later?
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Never eat before the show.
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Married?
Tell me.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
What are you thinking?
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
You mean that?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
You don't think--?
This is a business trip!
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
You take some awful chances.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Don't get yourself all worked up--
That's too bad.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
She did?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
O.K.! Send that!
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Yes.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
About twelve hundred.
I went for four.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
Thanks to me.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I'm all right.
Telegrams.
Ain't got time.
Isn't that a daisy?
Nice voice.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Where'd you get that horse?
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
This brand.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Better.
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
A which?
Don't touch me!
You really look awful.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
What?  But I saw 'em-
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
You know, we might just pull this off.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Just doesn't, that's all.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Come up to the fire, honey.
'Least you admit it.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Get down, boy.
I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
We should get moving.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Sir Elliot.
Briefly.
...And what's that, my dear?
- Instant melt-down.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
How is old Q?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Interesting video tape.
They point, I shoot.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
Who's in charge here?
Damn. It's doing it again.
That was too close.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Oh, no.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
What for?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.
I'm worn out.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
Since this morning.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
You should go back and rest.
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Now who are we talking about?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
What's a toby?
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Whadda ya think?
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Next stop...
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
But what if we leave them behind?
Hey!  Wow!
What?  What is it?
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
THAT is Sid!
Trouble?!  Where?!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
What happened to you?
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Great!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
B-3.
Are you peeking?
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
I don't know!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
I'm red this time.
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Is that all?
Well ... yes. All right. But -
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I already lost everything once.
Everything is gone, now.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Don't bother.
So my wife is lying?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Why?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
Oh, it is?
Did you tell Dad?
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
I'm third in my class.
You do?  What else you do?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
Are you getting this on tape?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
David --
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, sir!
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
You should feel good about this.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Like you protected Landry?
What do you mean?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Diane.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Smells like it.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
So, what's he like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
That's nice.
And you might get the fucking job.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Screenwriter?
OK, so who was it, then?
You don't know, do you?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
God, you're sick.
When are you going to visit him?
I can't believe you did that.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Four Grand.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
No, I don't think so.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
So what's it going to be?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
The ship....
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Captain?
What do you mean?
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
To land any closer would risk detection.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
Hmmm?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... the booster rockets.
What is this?
I must have your starship.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I trust your message was received?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I cannot go with you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
For being on to Dillinger.
Hello, Alan.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
The Pentagon?
If you think -
You wouldn't dare.
Yes?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.
There's another beam!
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Feel what? You okay?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
It's something Users do.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
I'm done.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Son of a bitch!
I thought you moved out.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
It can't be.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Guy's a spook!
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
And you've got one.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Did you read the papers yesterday?
That was you?!
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Who is this woman?
Let me speak to Clarence.
I didn't get any chicken.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
What do you want to know?
What kinda music do you like?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Is he nice?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Is this a joke?
What?
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I don't blame you.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
I'm a married man.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You're really in love, aren't you?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Clarence...
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
What do you think, eightball?
Where's everybody else?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
No. Not yet.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Nope.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Could we try it now?
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
He knows.
Put it in your pants.
Do you live here?
Where's that?
Change what?
You wouldn't understand.
Underground.
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
You're sure?
Just like that?  You were in prison?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Might be tight.
You want something, old man?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
He no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
You afraid of the dark?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
Nothing.
It's a Movado.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
Where to?
You own this place?
Yep.
Nothing.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
It's Grace.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
It's nothing.  Really.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
I guess it must.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
I have ideas.
You never did answer my question.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You just walk away.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
John, please--
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
I don't know.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
If you want.
What about him?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
But you said we could be together.
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
What for?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
Nice office you've got.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
No.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
All I have in the world.
Darrell giving you problems?
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
I came to kill her.
Not from where I stand.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
Not before I settle with you.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
You broke my nose!
California...
Hey!
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
How do you want it?
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
Next time you'll do just fine.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
How old are you?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Harlin around?
Twenty-after-ten.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
No! Okay! Okay!
I want my car.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
You're welcome, Grace.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
How do you know he's still not here?
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You'd never understand.
Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
The money's right here! Get the key!
Good thinking.  What's all this?
I'm not sailing his boat.
And I love you too.
Where to?
One way.
You got a beer?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Not a specific day. What's this about?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
You've never been sick?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
When?
I won't make any noise.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm going to work out.
I mean if you knew karate?
You're lying.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
Where is it?
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
We was... lyin'.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
He tell you where them others is?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Yeah, I guess.
Shit and fried eggs.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Alive?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
They really got all that money, them whores?
That much, huh?
I could run off them whores.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
But... if he doesn't miss?
Is... is it... loaded?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
He's... he's dead.
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
Maybe I ain't.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Three ways, I figured.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Get some sleep, Kid.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
He's in there.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
I can't see 'em.
Wha... what f-for?
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Huh?
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Two weeks, I guess.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
HEY, KID.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
What is it, son?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
The Kid, yeah...
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Fuck you.
He's blind, for Chri...
Say, Ned... ?
His pistol must of jammed.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
An' if I spot 'em?
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
You heard right.
You watch your mouth.
You okay?
We'll make it.
What-are they speaking?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Let's say for example -
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
What did you say?
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Who is he?
What do you mean I can't see him?
Two hours, tops.
Someplace else, then.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
Then why didn't you help him?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
What did he find?
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
And what did your team do...
Objection, we've...
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Orthopedics?
What book is that?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
... that's all right.
What is this going to cost?
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
'Code Blue'...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
No, you did fine.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Right.  Who called?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
The most respected ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Listen to me, fella...
Overruled...
Mr. Alito, please.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Maybe I can do something right.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Do you want me to go...?
I...do you want me to leave?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Dr. Gruber.
... now who is that ...?
What do you want?
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
I can't talk now.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
... I'm sure you do ...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... I know.  I went ...
... I understand ...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
One hour.
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Huh.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
From whom?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
Well?
How can I see her, to know her?
Yes.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
And when she goes to those places...
Hello.
What happened?
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
What about?
You.
You won't have to.
About three years.
Will you have dinner with me?
Tomorrow morning.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
I'll take care of you.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Why?!
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Ernie's?
Mmmm.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
We're going up the tower.
What are you going to do?
No...
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
One shouldn't live alone.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Do you know where you're going?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
No!... No!
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No... it's in shadow.
Where?
I'm here, I've got you...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Where's your husband?
Yes --
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
My love... because I love you.
Where?
Let me go! Let me go!!
Is there something I can do for you?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Carlotta Valdes?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Her car is gone.
How do you know? Personal experience?
I had to quit, Midge.
It wasn't your fault.
How's your love life, Midge?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Who?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Here you are.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Oh... this and that.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
What have you been doing?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
I said how's it going?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
What are you doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Stop it!
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
What?
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
We have to get going.
I am not flexible on this.
Don't snap at them!
What?
Don't ever stare him down.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I want you to hear me out.
So. When is the wedding.
No I don't.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Shut up Boyd.
Easy Boyd.
Boyd...What have we done?
Say it again.
What's your point?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Hear what?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
The hell you didn't!
They need leadership.
What?
This is ridiculous.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
I think so.
Why did you forget the tent check?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
Keith do not trivialize this.
What kind of seats can we have?
So what do we do?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Do you love me?
The chairs.
Yeah. You.
What are you talking about?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
What?
No...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
What does that mean?
I'm getting married...
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
Did she believe you?
My God...
Yeah?
"You Send Me."
Oh I know that. How does it go...
A mutant species.
Right.
Give them to Refugio.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
How long are you staying?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
How could anybody behave like that?
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!
You must think I'm mad.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
That's it.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Do they worry you that much, then?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
I'll be ready.
You cannot leave ...
There's been an accident.
A black bull came.
Yes!
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
What about you, Manuel?
How did you see me?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
You son-of—a—bitch, I'm going to kill you.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Not from in here.
What did you find out?
Enough to level an entire city block.
You need a maid.
What's wrong with Parker?
Talk so I can understand.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Who said that?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're re—adapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Where the hell are you going?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——

Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Ask it.

He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
I go with this here... 
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
Yes.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
The hats.
Just want to take a nap.
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
Oh really.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Yeah, where's your machine gun.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
What brings you out here...
Don't start, alright.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Whatever night you like.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
What are you doing here?
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
So you're hot on this stock?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Okay.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
Oh no, no...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
So. See you Friday.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Hi.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
With Mark?
But?
Yes, I guess you're right
Thank you Jenkins
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
No Jonathan.
No?
Can I give her a message?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
So much.
Yes, but...
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Well maybe your wife...
Who?
Who are you?
Hello?
That's not...It's not like that.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Um...sure.
What was her major?
I didn't sleep with him.
Good.  I'm good.
What is it?
Yep.
It's niiice.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Sit down here.
Oh...
I have to go.
Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
I know.
Like what?
I don't know...
Did you...
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Did she say that?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
Claire...
Hi.
What kind of whispering?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
I didn't do that.
Dressed?
Oh.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Norman...
Are you lonely?
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Sweetheart--
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Do I have everything?
I felt you...looking through me...
We walked all night...
In the living room...
Not personally.
Stop...
Who?
Stop...
We have to get out of here.
It's alright.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Lasher - bring us through!
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
uh - then he - be just -
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
But I could understand. I want to understand!
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
They like you ------- kids.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Ro, how long have we known each other.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
No.    This is unreal...
What were you talking about...?
Stop it!
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
The one on the left - definitely...
CHIC MAGAZINE?
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
Do you take sugar?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
What?
I want you out now
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
Is LESLIE here?
What's this all about?
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dr STECKLER?
Yes...?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Sugar?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
That's crazy talk.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Dead?
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
What gives, Don Corleone?
We reinvented ourselves.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
You guys are my parents.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Sorry I--
Well?
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
It's not up to me.
Great.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Your article sucked.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Well? What do you think of her?
Why can't you be nice to me?
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's all so complicated.
And then what?
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
I see.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
Merritt, Forensics.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Did you try to fight him?
Try, Kelly.
Maybe she used another name.
It's our job, Gloria.
Unless what?
Eliminate the competition.
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Did he come in with you?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Are you crazy, Ray?
Kelly's next, Gloria.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Get off my property.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
I don't know.  I want to see you...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
That's not your line.
Forget it.
Nellie Gail Ranch...
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
Just like that?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Who is it?
The one you bought at school.
Yes.
That was about as grim as it gets.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Didn't you see her this morning?
J. S. Bach.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Always hoping.  Or this...
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Aha!
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Relax.  We're almost there.
Not again.
When we find him, he is mine.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Your guests, ma'am?
My.  It's gotten longer.
And?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
They look like acorns.
We're a tiny version of all that?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
She said lots of thing.s
Want me to carry Elora?
She's a bird, Willow.
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Can't we keep it, Dada?
No.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
How am I gonna do that?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
What'd you bit me for!!
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Time is running out.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
Madmartigan.
She's hungry.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
This is not going well.
Maybe milking.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Hey, Sam...
Is it them?
Have you got your gun on now?
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
What was that?
Oh? Anything else?
Home.
Who are they?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Where's the nearest telephone?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
I know what he said.
The... bullets?
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
But... You may not be well enough.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
I hear you.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You'd lie to protect him.
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Is this where we're going?
Momma... are they angry with us.
Aunt Em!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
I don't believe you!
Oh --
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
That's right.  What's she doing?
...paper?
...bed.
Did you say something?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh --
Oh --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
We might.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
But why?  Why?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
To Oz?
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oil can what?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Ah --
Up!
You don't get around us that easy!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
No, sir!
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Now, now, don't fret.
...to Dorothy!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Well, I --
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
The inside man?
Who did you get it from?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
I understand it’s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Where did you get this?
Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Now...where were we?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
And the payoff on the tables?
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
No idea who's behind this?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
I won't do that.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
Who?
She's with me.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I¹m not.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
. . . What?
Laurie --
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're following us.
They're practically on us . . .
What's he doing?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
I don't know their real names.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
What do I get out of it?
Not bad for a gimp.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
"Anarchy" 99"?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
I was invited. What's your story?
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had two days.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
That's the guy.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
We all do.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
You know, you --
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
What do you want?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Who?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
What did she do to me?
Is that so?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
No!
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Where did you get this cauliflower?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Baack!
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Of course.
Yes, don't worry.
Will you miss me?
Oh, nice.
I suppose you're right.
There seem to be quite a few books.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Why did you do that?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
A piece of what?
My father was a sick man.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
But, sir...
Are you putting me on?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
Taking the book along?
How?
Was he any good?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Throw the second switch!
You can't win 'em all.
You'll be getting me sad next.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
No, no!  That whole thing!
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
Hello there.
Get the sedative ready!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
MMMmmmmmm.
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Are you busy?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
And look at this, Doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Right here?
I think you've done it, master.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
I think so.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Are you ready for me?
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
How long is it so far?
Yes.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
